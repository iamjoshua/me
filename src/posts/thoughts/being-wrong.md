The feeling of "rightness" of an idea is a product of the knowledge that one has. In contrast, the feeling of "wrongness" is a product of contradictory knowledge that one has. And so most of us tend to assume that when we don't feel uncertain about an idea, that we must be right. But what feeling can be a product of knowledge that one does not have? Why should we ever blindly trust our intuitions of right and wrong when we can clearly see that unknown knowledge can produce no feeling of its own? This is the core cause of confident ignorance. Once acquired, however, this knowledge that unknown knowledge potentially exists, can produce a feeling of skepticism.
