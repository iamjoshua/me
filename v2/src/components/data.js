I checked the BrainWash calendar on their website and they host an open mike at 8pm (so any performers out there could kill two birds with one hammer). The BrainWash Cafe is a change from where we used to meet (Crepes on Cole), an experiment, we can decide future venues at the meetup. You can bring your laundry if you wish and do it while we meet (three birds), parking should be easy. For Muni/Bart - get off at the Civic Center station, walk down 8th, and go left on Folsom.</p> <p>Thanks for thinking about thinking.</p> <p>David</p> <p><a href="http://www.brainwash.com/map.html">BrainWash Cafe Map / Website</a></p> ",

"description": "<p>Greetings,</p> <p>For April, our topic is: soul?</p> <p>(continental perspective)</p> <p>Soul? is a broad topic and, perhaps more interesting than the answer, are the varieties of approach one could take to answer the question. How might your favorite philosophers, and of course, the most important philosopher - yourself, approach the question. The topic could be interpreted in a variety of ways, for example, soul or no soul; soul and no soul; soul yielding to subjectivitity; Eastern thought contrasted with western thought; subjective truth versus objective truth, etc. The implications of the question can be far reaching, so dig the hole you wish to dig. If the meeting gets a bit tense, this is all well and good, for it should.</p> <p>(analytic-ish perspective)</p> <p>Soul? We ended our last meeting with most leaning towards determinism, while some held out that our sense of choice is not an illusion. So, is soul an illusion? Put another way, is our will our own or does it belong to a god or an agent-less causal chain? A soul implies a separate entity that guides our physical form; where as no soul, and thus no ethereal realm, implies a purposeless system of particles bumping in the dark. The former bespeaks Dualism, championed by Descartes and others, while the latter describes a stochastic form of Monism. Are these the only options? Certainly not. But the question remains in the overlap between these timeless dichotomies: what is the nature of will and where does it reside?</p> <p>For thousands of years many renowned philosophers have added to this debate. I?ve uploaded a very short reading that references a handful of these thinkers to make a case for a middle way between soul and no soul...just to get the discussion going.</p> <p>We look forward to meeting you and hearing your thoughts. We will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>David and Josh</p> ",

"description": "<p>Greetings,</p> <p>For May, our topic is: self?</p> <p>Our last three meetings have focused on the question of self: its soul, its will and how it should live. A conception of self, however, begs a larger question: What constitutes the self? Is it a thing or is it a process; or both? Is it memories, genetic inheritance and/or the influence of fellow selves? In any case, the self is not an autonomous agent unaffected by the world it seeks to mold. The self is of its world and the world is then molded by groups of selves striving for their collective ends. In turn, that world molds the singular self.</p> <p>Due to its location on Memorial Day, we thought it would be good to recap a recurring thread that has pervaded our recent meetings and we are sure to see again. This thread, the nature of self and its relation to its world, underlies the most fundamental question of philosophy: the nature of being. For, without being, all other questions are rendered mute.</p> <p>20th century philosophy recognizes the self as a nexus of narratives. In order to further understand these inherited stories that constitute our sense of self, modern philosophers have put these stories under the microscope; their histories, power dynamics and preconceptions. These stories about stories are meta-narratives. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida">Jacques Derrida</a> has questioned these coveted stories thus deconstructing our faith in biography; our desire to see the self as a fixed story that we can definitively know in its entirety. So, if I can't completely know myself, then who does? Other selves, perhaps; my friends, family, community, nation and species. Without this evolved culture would I even be a homo sapien? Does the boundary of my-self end at my skin or does my-self extend into culture to then constitute other selves?</p> <p>These are important questions since ethics of law and war are predicated on the tacit assumption that at some point the group is within its right to mold the freedom of the one. So, where does the one end and the many begin? At what point do I relinquish the telling of my story to the group? At what point is it prudent for the one to derail the story being told by the many?</p> <p>Please review the wiki on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida">Jacques Derrida</a> to get us started. We look forward to meeting you and hearing your thoughts. We will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>David and Josh</p> ",

To give some structure, but not so much as to load the outcome, you are invited to use the fable of King Midas as a jumping off point, a springboard for your interest or passion, for what you value in philosophy. Post your take - your ideas or your favorite ideas - in the files section and/or discuss at the meetup.</p> <p>We will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>- David and Josh</p> <p>The fable of King Midas:</p> <p>King Midas was a very kind man who ruled his kingdom fairly, but he was not one to think very deeply about what he said. One day, while walking in his garden, he saw an elderly satyr asleep in the flowers. Taking pity on the old fellow, King Midas let him go without punishment. When the god Dionysus heard about it, he rewarded King Midas by granting him one wish. The king thought for only a second and then said I wish for everything I touch to turn to gold." And so it was.</p> <p>The beautiful flowers in his garden turned toward the sun for light, but when Midas approached and touched them, they stood rigid and gold. The king grew hungry and thin, for each time he tried to eat, he found that his meal had turned to gold. His lovely daughter, at his loving touch, turned hard and fast to gold. His water, his bed, his clothes, his friends, and eventually the whole palace was gold.</p> <p>King Midas saw that soon his whole kingdom would turn to gold unless he did something right away. He asked Dionysus to turn everything back to the way it had been and take back his golden touch. Because the king was ashamed and very sad, Dionysus took pity on him and granted his request. Instantly, King Midas was poorer that he had been, but richer, he felt, in the things that really count.</p> ",

"description": "<p>Greetings,</p> <p>The nature of Truth quickly begs questions ontological in nature, for what is the nature of a reality that can give rise to Truth? Is our perception of this reality an illusion; is Truth some fixed and unchanging state beyond our perception, only attainable via pure reason and logic as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parmenides">Parmenides </a>claimed? Or perhaps Truth is the perception of a reality that is ever changing as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclitus">Heraclitus </a>sages : “We both step and do not step in the same rivers. We are and are not.” Both these pre-Socratics posit two very different perspectives to the perennial question of Truth; is it timeless and ideal or is it process and contingent?</p> <p>Our Western culture in spirit evokes the lineage of Parmenides through Plato via a dialectic populated by either/or syllogisms; truthful premises and logic determine whether proposition ‘A’ is or is not. There is no middle ground (for more see the Law of the Excluded Middle). In practice, however, we know that premises and laws change relative to the culture and political environment they find themselves; killing another is both justified and unjustified...’A’ is and it is not. Eastern cultures are more permissive of the “middle” as the logical propositions neither/nor ‘A’ and both/and ‘A’ are not so routinely dismissed as in the West.</p> <p>Some modern physicists, such as Fritjof Capra, are enamored with Eastern culture’s predilection for paradox as it coincides with the empirical findings of Quantum Mechanics; the electron is there and it is not there. But a Parmenidian might claim that such “perceptions” are illusions that defy logic. A Heraclitian might counter that such logic preconceives premises that are false categories; a river is a river in name only...the debate rages on.</p> <p>But do we have to pick a side? Is there a “middle way”; neither one nor the other? Perhaps <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaximander">Anaximander</a>, an early pre-Socratic, can offer something. He advocates that nature is ruled by laws, but his physics also asserts that the “indefinite” is the source of all things; a concept called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apeiron_%28cosmology%29">Apeiron </a>that anticipates the indeterminacy of modern physics. Such relativism, however, chafes the sensibility of many thinkers; both ancient and modern.</p> <p>A question to ponder for next time is whether Truth is a fixed object, an ever changing perception or is reality itself, and thus Truth, an emergent phenomenon born of a primordial potentiality akin to apeiron?</p> <p>We will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>- David and Josh</p> ",

"description": "<p>Greetings,</p> <p>Recently, I started reading Moran’s On Phenomenology and Derrida’s On Grammatology in order to better understand the 20th century's approach to rationalism...whew! In the introduction, Moran asserts that “for Husserl, the central mystery of all philosophy, the ‘mystery of mysteries’ is the question: how does objectivity get constituted in and for consciousness?”. This question echoes the debates of philosophy since Hericlitus. Every movement in Philosophy grapples in some form with this question: How does the object constitute the subject, or, conversely, how does the subject constitute the object? Even the debate between Hericlitus and Permenides can be framed by this question. Are the connections between words (logos) or the words themselves fundamental? Aristotle tackled this dichotomy in his metaphysics with his notion of potentiality; a concept his contemporaries in the Megaric school denied. They asserted that “a thing...either is or is not in a certain state” , while Aristotle insisted that item A has some inherent potential to be B in its current state, so that, when it does become B the “change is not catastrophic.”1</p> <p>We can not expect to resolve the truth of this dichotomy in one evening. Never the less, we can refine our understanding by begging the question of what an object is and how it might relate to a subject. Is my conception of object A the same as yours because we have the same word for it? A deeper question is whether I am an object or a subject? Am I a reliable documenter of myself as an alleged object of observation? Derrida was largely suspicious of someone being their own reliable autobiographer. In some cases, others are better at observing our own natures. These questions simultaneously challenge the primacy of the subject, as the Phenomenologist sought to champion, and the timeless stability of the object, of which the more idealist projects sought to stabilize.</p> <p>Phenomenologist , along with the idealistic project of Modernism, in the first half of the 20th century were skeptical of the preconceptions of history and culture. They sought to find the fundamental constituents of thought and form by transcending history and tradition. Modernism ran into problems when this effort towards universality assumed forms that themselves became imbued with their own preconceived narratives. Similarly, Husserl, one of the first champions of Phenomenology, struggled to instantiate a rigorous and scientific project whereby the subject’s observations could be rendered in a timeless and universal framework of meaning.</p> <p>Post modernism came along to point out the irony of these projects. This movement, in large part, had no expressed goal. They employed historical icons often in capricious juxtaposition to one another to simultaneously challenge the preconceptions of cultural forms/texts and the efforts of the modernists to transcend those preconceptions by transcending history. Deconstructionism and late century Phenomenology were not as dismissive of history’s relevance as the Modernist or Post modernist. They realized that a philosophical project bent on extricating historical inputs is doomed to inadvertently fill the vacuum with their own preconceptions, which soon thwarts the very progress such projects seek to preserve. Of course, constructive projects such as Modernism are necessary. Some philosophers are needed to assert a system so that others may advocate for or against it. A society of critics doesn’t leave much content to critique.</p> <p>The recent debates echo ancient debates; all of which are trying to refine our relation to each other and the “objects” around us. And at the heart of ontology, etymology, et al. is the question of morphogenesis – the growth of ordered structure. How do some things beget other things; or have some things always existed? Do subjects construct objects to be deconstructed by other subjects? Or are the objects timeless and fixed thus molding all subjects? Or are both subjects and objects molded by each other; in which case subjectivity and objectivity blur into one.</p> <p>As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>- Josh</p> <p>1 Sir David Ross, Aristotle, p. 182</p> ",

"description": "<p>Hi everybody,</p> <p>I'm a little behind this time around. Also, <b>note the change in date.</b> I've started a program at SFSU and I have class Monday nights this semester, so I've moved the meeting to Wednesday. I'm sorry for any inconveniences. I look forward to meeting folks who could never make it on Monday.</p> <p>We didn't end last meeting with a consensus on topic for this upcoming meeting, so let's explore the time honored question of "Why Philosophize at all?" To provide a starting point, I will define such an activity as cultural critical discourse; specifically, the refinement of our collective thought by making claims justified by reasons supported by evidence and/or logic.</p> <p>Can today's philosopher refine the project of science, art and religion or are these projects self contained and perfect in their progress toward their own brands of truth? In an age of increased information flow and ever present mediation, it seems that faith in the doctrines of one’s own discipline is a deceptive yet necessary sanctuary. Critical thought, able to encompass and synthesize the gamut of contemporary knowledge, becomes more difficult as the current of change flows ever harder thus eroding one's capacity for rigor.</p> <p>Where do philosophers fit in this torrent? They cannot be experts in all the fields they may impact. UC Berkeley’s John Searle challenged a group of technicians and researches at the IBM Almaden Institute’s Cognitive Computation conference in 2006, stating that the current paradigm of cognitive research was predicated on false premises. Prof. Searle is not a computer scientist nor a neuroscientist. So, can we assert that his rigorous inquiry into such matters is still valid? Perhaps someone disciplined in the art of critical discourse, as defined above, is able to effectively broaden their view to encompass multiple disciplines. This broader view, though not able to make specific claims within specific disciplines, may be able to make claims about the premises that such fields forget to question.</p> <p>Is the critique of a discipline’s preconceptions useful? Is critical thought, and by extension philosophizing, useful to specialized researchers; or are such inquiries annoying barriers to progress? Would we achieve, through trial and error, our scientific and artistic goals without rigorous skepticism of one’s inherited assumptions? Or would an increased focus on critical thought in our educational curriculums spur new productivity. Surely, there is some balance between action and reflection. But can we make a strong case for rigorous reflection upon one’s reasons for action? Is the common denominator of critical discourse lacking from our specialized and isolated institutions?</p> <p>As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>- Josh</p> ",

"description": "<p>Greetings, I am Paul, the new assitant organizer. The topic for this month's meetup wlll be 'What is Wisdom?" Is wisdom a kind of knowledge? If so, what is it knowledge about? Peripherally, though 'philosophy' means 'love of wisdom' in ancient Greek, is wisdom really the aim of philosophy in its present forms? If so, how can philosophical inquiry lead to wisdom?</p> <p>In conducting this month's meetup, my approach may differ a bit from usual. Rather than suggesting specific reading, I would like you to read what you wish but more importantly seek to clarify how you understand wisdom. 'Wisdom' is a word that means something possibly different to each of us, and discussing such perspectives is what I would like the meetup conversation to be about. To me, this is more interesting than discussing our views on what other, non-present, thinkers have thought about wisdom. But discussion of what others have thought will be welcome too.</p> <p>As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>- Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>Holiday Greetings Everybody, the eggnog is my only excuse for topic tardiness, but alas here it is.</p> <p><b>Substance</b></p> <p>It seems like we may have a smaller group, so I’d like to explore people’s perspectives on an often neglected topic; however, one that underpins all other assertions. This topic is substance. What do you think reality is made of? Is it animal, mineral or vegetable? Aristotle proposed his atomos, which underpins today’s natural philosophy of atomism. Wiki describes atomism as “the theory that all the objects in the universe are composed of very small, indestructible building blocks - atoms (Aristotle, Metaphysics, I, 4, 985 b, 10-15).” But what connects such irreducible items. Aristotle himself gets in a little trouble with his notion of potentiality whereby object A can only become object B if it was already B potentially. In some sense B-ness must be present already in A for it to transform into B; otherwise, catastrophic change would be the only means of change.(1) Dualism, on the other hand, posits that the connection between A and B is beyond the physical realm. For example, god could relate each little discrete node of space and time. This way they never have to overlap or intermingle. Each particle in physical substance is told what to do by some otherwise divine substance. We merely perceive a re-arrangement of these indivisible “atoms”. Spinoza, on the other hand, advocated for Monism; the idea that there is only one substance. Whether one perceives it as divine or material is a function of that person’s perspective. For Spinoza all modes of reality are attributes of just one substance. In this way object A is potentially any other object for it is formed out of the same continuous substance.</p> <p>This may seem an esoteric question to some, but all questions whether ontological, epistemological or even scientific would be served by begging this question before any warrants are granted that underpin some claim. Questions of subject/object, freewill and semiotics serve themselves by addressing any assumptions about substance before articulating a model of reality no matter how esoteric or practical. I claim this is so, because all relationships between entities living or not rely on the exchange of ordered patterns; whether atoms conversing via the 4 universal forces or two people conversing in a common language. For some, these ordered patterns are composed of discrete states, like those in a computer. What governs these states is some other meta-state; whether it be an algorithm or god. Others claim that ordered patterns are both the objects and their means of relating. To them A is already partly B and vise versa. In any case, presupposing the nature of the underlying substance bears significantly on how a proposed model can claim to represent reality.</p> <p>Questions of freewill and causality are especially dependant on this question. Throughout human history, we wonder whether we are the cause of our own discord or is it imposed upon us from without? Does my action change someone’s mind, does our collective behavior create the market or vise versa, can my action change the behavior of a terrorist? Is happiness a thing, is it contagious and can it be made? One way to see these questions in a new way is to wonder what they are made of and how these substances may relate and potentially form each other.</p> <p>I look forward to your thoughts on these questions. As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Josh</p> <p>(1) Sir David Ross, Aristotle, Routledge Press, 1995, p.182</p> ",

"description": "<p>Welcome to '09!</p> <p>This year I'd like to go back to an older more inclusive format where you guys have a chance to suggest and moderate topics of your choice. Over the last months the topic has been chosen by a very few people. I'd like to open it up to all of you. So, at the end of each meeting I'll ask if there are any topics that really interest folks. If so, hopefully someone with expertise or a specific interest in that area would volunteer to write a short intro as we've done to date to get the discussion going. I’d also enjoy seeing other member’s moderation styles. Please don’t hesitate to volunteer to moderate for a meeting or two if you are interested.</p> <p>Also, in keeping with the greater inclusion I'd like to also share the cost this year as times are a little tighter. Meetup.com charges about $14 a month so I'll ask that everyone who comes to the meeting contribute $2. I believe it is possible to contribute through the Meetup website as well if you'd like to contribute but are unable to make a meeting. All contributions will go to paying the monthly subscription. Thank you all very much for your involvement.</p> <p>Now onto some philosophy. For this month let's talk about the mind. Specifically, let’s consider whether a mind can be realized by other means than an embodied brain. For some local input check out John Searle’s thought experiment called the Chinese Room where he argues that a discrete symbol processing machine (e.g. your computer) cannot manifest a mind:</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_room"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.o" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.o</a>...</a></p> <p>For further background on this debate see the wiki on the Turing test:</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.o" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.o</a>...</a></p> <p>This discussion is related to last months discussion on substance since both these topics beg the question of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Materialism">Materialism </a>and its cousin <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physicalism">Physicalism</a>. If one holds to either of these doctrines, it follows that a mind can be artificially constructed. Searle does not deny this outright. However, he does assert that the specific kind of machine that is a digital computer cannot manifest a mind.</p> <p>I look forward to your thoughts. As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Josh</p> ",

"description": "<p>Oh my, it took me much longer than usual to compose this month's topic for discussion. I've tried to incorporate a number of topic suggestions from members, which had something of a common thread. As such, this month's topic deviates from our recent discussions regarding more metaphysical strains of philosophy in favor of more political strains. To get the discussion going, I've written a brief essay that references ideas from Plato, Aristotle and DeTocqueville regarding the evolution of stable and “right constitutions”. Click the ‘Files’ button on the left side of this page and there you will find the essay I uploaded on February 21st. I hope it inspires a lively discussion.</p> <p>As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Josh</p> ",

"description": "<p>It seems still relevant to stick with a political theme as we watch the United States and the world struggle to regain its collective composure. Towards this end I’m pleased to introduce Martin Carcieri, Assistant Professor in the Dept. of Political Science at San Francisco State. I invite you to peruse his faculty <a href="http://bss.sfsu.edu/polisci/faculty_profiles/carcieri.htm">webpage</a>, which is replete with academic acumen. Specifically, he is finishing a book entitled, “Rawls, Reparations and the Drug War: Toward a Theory of Practice of Racial Justice”. He has kindly offered to compose a concise introduction to Rawls’ theories as they relate to our collective perception of equality and justice. This brief essay is located in the files section and I invite you to read it.</p> <p>Martin’s summary brings up many compelling questions, not the least of which is the question of fair access to resources. If I understand correctly, Rawls advocates lowering the barriers into the most advantages institutions for the most disadvantaged among us. We are fortunate to have Martin help us navigate these important questions.</p> <p>As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Josh</p> ",

"description": "<p>Please note that I've cancelled the April meeting due to very low turnout. The following remains the same for May. Hope to have a rousing discussion then.</p> <p>We had a great discussion last time regarding Rawls. I'd like to thank Marty once again for his contribution to our evening. We will revisit political philosophy from time to time, but it seems some folks missed our more metaphysical discussions. So, in that spirit, I'll suggest a general topic now and invite feedback over the next week or so. With this feedback, I'll focus the topic for our April 22nd meeting.</p> <p>My suggestion is to explore a corollary to a topic that the Berkeley philosophy group has explored a few times in recent months, namely, irrationality. Our SF group and the Berkeley group have discussed rationality a number of times over the last few years, but what is the role of irrationality? Is it necessary for sentients? Is it “random”, and if so how does it underpin or distract the rational mind? Science fiction often explores this supposed dichotomy between the rational (or logical; e.g. Spock) and the irrational or intuitive mind. Are these qualities at odds with one another, complimentary or necessary to define the other? Paradoxically, does an open system (such as life on Earth) require an irrational element to maintain vitality; and if we claim it does, can we define it? Or, by its very nature is it indefinable?</p> <p>I invite you to offer comments on the above litany of questions. I will try and cohere your thoughts/further questions into a focused topic for discussion at our next meeting.</p> <p>As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Josh</p> ",

"description": "<p>Greetings, co-organizer Paul here. This month's topic will be conceptual relativism and, more generally, the relationship between reality and our understanding of reality. This topic was inspired by something in our last meet-up on irrationality, so the short essay located <a href="http://www.pmpaolini.com/">here</a>, on conceptual relativism, is only an attempt to give our discussion some reference points, and not the result of something I have thought about for a long time. Thus, your own thoughts on the questions the essay raises are at least as important to our discussion as the thoughts of the essay. Also, as usual, if you know of any writings, in any tradition, that are relevant to the topic, please upload them to the files section or start a discussion on the message board.</p> <p>As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>This meet up is organized by co-organizer Paul and new member Carli. In this month's meeting, our interest will be the range of questions that may be asked about the relationship between philosophical understanding and works of fiction and fiction writing.</p> <p>If philosophical understanding is taken as insight on the most basic questions of life, it seems clear that good works of fiction are at minimum something from which philosophical understanding can be gleaned. Fiction can be seen as a meditation on existence; it uses imaginary selves—that is, characters—to explore questions such as what role chance plays in life or how unconscious drives influence action. Fiction portrays each action as belonging to a rich, varied web of experience; by tracing this web we perceive how myriad factors— psychological, historical and existential—impact one another.</p> <p>In addition to questions such as the role that chance plays in life and how hidden motivations determine action, what are some philosophical questions that fiction seems primed to explore? Is film capable of undertaking the same questions? Are the questions posed by fiction (and film) merely a subset of those known by conventional philosophizing, or might fiction as philosophizing, due perhaps to recreating experience as experienced, have access to questions that cannot be accessed any other way?</p> <p>It seems clear, too, that fictional works are capable of generating moral insight. Yet the novel in particular has been accused of being an amoral genre. This may be due to the view held by some writers and theorists that the novel presupposes that all truths are embodied truths; each perspective within a fictional work has the same “value” because each perspective is necessary to the total created universe of the work. (The novelist Milan Kundera goes so far as to say that, “Knowledge is the novel’s only morality”; “A novel that does not discover a hitherto unknown segment of existence is immoral.”) Given this inherent “relativity”, can fictional works lend readers moral knowledge? Is film as an art form more suited to conveying moral truths?</p> <p>Three files provided for this meet-up are now in the files section of this website. The first file is an interview with fiction writer Milan Kundera (author of "The Unbearable Lightness of Being"). In this fascinating interview, though Kundera is averse to identifying fiction too closely with philosophy, he does not avoid revealing how rich fiction is as a philosophical topic. The second file provides page 8 of the Kundera interview, which did not come out in the PDF. The third file is a short story, "Eveline", by James Joyce.</p> <p>As usual, we will meet at 7pm, settle in, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul and Carli</p> ",

"description": "<p>As promised, this month's topic will be on the nature of the self. As the self is a very broad topic, I've narrowed the questions to two that I see as fundamental to the self as a philosophical subject. These are:</p> <p>1) What sort of entity is the self? Is it a natural entity or a supernatural entity or something else? If it is a natural entity, what ontological category does it fit into? Is it a physical entity? If not, what else could it be?</p> <p>2) How are our selfhoods composed? Is there a fact of the matter regarding who a given person is that that person is either true to or not, or is a selfhood essentially a reflection of values and choices?</p> <p>These questions shall form the centers of our discussion, with readings as resources. That is, our focus shall be on the questions rather than on particular writings on these questions. Perhaps the discussion will be divided into two parts that address each of the above questions successively. We'll discuss how we want to proceed at the beginning of the meet up.</p> <p>As to readings, a short essay that I have written on the first question may be found here:</p> <p><a href="http://www.pmpaolini.com"><a href="http://www.pmpaolini" class="linkified">http://www.pmpaolini</a>....</a></p> <p>These entries on Wikipedia are very relevant:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(philosophy"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.o" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.o</a>...</a>)<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.o" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.o</a>...</a></p> <p>Feel free to let us know about your favored relevant essays and/or to submit your own short essays on the topic.</p> <p>As usual, we will meet at 7pm, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>In Zettel, a collection of remarks that Wittgenstein wrote on slips of paper (= zettel), compiled and edited by G.E.M. Anscombe and G.H. Von Wright, Wittgenstein states:</p> <p>The philosopher is not a citizen of any community of ideas. That is what makes him a philosopher.</p> <p>In the first half of our September meet, we will take this cryptic though very weighty remark of Wittgenstein's as a reference point in considering the question of what it means to be a philosopher. As how we answer this question might have implications for what we are all about as a philosophy group, it might be especially relevant.</p> <p>In the second half of our meet, we will stay on the theme of Wittgenstein and philosophy, but shift focus to the nature of philosophy with Wittgenstein's thought in general as a reference point on philosophy's scope, limits and purpose.</p> <p>The co-organizer for this meet up is Martin Carcieri, who teaches political theory at San Francisco State University and has an MA in philosophy along with a PhD in Political Science and a JD. Martin has assembled a few pages of relevant Wittgenstein quotes, which may be found in our files section. All students of Wittgenstein are encouraged to send or post suggestions, links or PDF texts or scans, and generally all relevant contributions are welcome. Wittgenstein's Zettel statement, and Martin's Wittgenstein quotes will be our central texts, however.</p> <p>This meet does not presuppose a significant understanding of Wittgenstein or philosophy, but is rather one that is designed to teach us all something about both, regardless of degree of experience.</p> <p>We'll meet at 7pm at our new venue (to be determined), meet and greet, and kick off the first topic at 7:30. After a short break around 9pm, we'll reconvene for the second topic. As a further note about our new venue, while the tipping-point (that is, the point where discussion quality starts to decline rapidly as attendance increases) at The Liberties was around 10 members, it will be a goal in scouting the new venue to find a place where the tipping-point is at least 20. With quietude and non-submarinesque seating, 20-25 should not be too large a group on occasions where that level of interest arises.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>Our topic for November is generously framed by member Carli Cutchin, who is a doctoral student in literature at NYU. The topic is the philosophy of work life with a focus on the notion of a <i>vocation</i>, which is a work life that stands as "a calling", or "what one is meant to do", or "what best realizes one's talents". While many people see having a vocation as an ideal, it is not unreasonable to disaffirm the idea for one's self: one might see making money and developing one's talent as two different areas of life. What is your view on this question, and generally what is your philosophy about your work life? A short essay by Carli framing this topic is in the files section of this site along with readings (labeled 'Vocation Meet') that Carli has provided as background reading for those interested.</p> <p>As a note on our venue, it seemed that with each successive meet, the Irish Bank grew louder. Fortunately, just around the corner on Kearny, is Murphy's Pub, which has a quiet, pleasant small enclosed room that I have booked a table in for our next meet. Also, my experiment with capping meets to 10 revealed that its complications are not worth its benefits. So once again, members may RSVP 'maybe', decide to attend at the last moment, and so on, just like the old days.</p> <p>As usual, we will convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and kick of the topic at 7:30.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> <p>p.s. join our philosophy conversations on Facebook by friend-requesting Paul M. Paolini!</p> ",

"description": "<p>As this meet is very short notice, I've decided to go with a simple topic that we've all thought about, and which therefore does not require much preparation for good conversation. This topic is the nature of reality ;-)</p> <p>What is reality? To some, this question might seem to be merely a fool's treadmill. But like a puzzle box, I believe there is a way to approach it so that it opens up to reveal quite manageable questions. Below, I develop a thumbnail theory as a reference point and primer of thought for our meet conversation.</p> <p>A common misstep that leads to confusion in understanding the nature of reality is to assume, at least implicitly, that reality is an *empirical concept*. To explain, an empirical concept is a concept of something that we can learn about only through observation. For example, the respective concepts of a duck, a lake, and a star, represent things that we can learn about only through observation. Though we might say that we can learn about the nature of reality through observation, the word 'nature' here does not have the same sense that it does in the question: What is the nature of reality? In the former sense, the word 'nature' is synonymous with 'facts about'; in the latter sense, 'nature' concerns *what reality is*. How we might be falsely led to think of reality as an empirical concept may become more apparent through considering the falsity of the following claim: We can learn about the nature of truth through observation. Because truth is more well-recognized as a *rational concept*, i.e., a non-empirical concept, we interpret 'nature' within the claim in the 'what it is' sense and note the futility of learning about such through observation. While we can learn truths through observation, we cannot learn what truth is through observation.</p> <p>Now, let us see what emerges when we think of reality as not only a rational concept, but a *logical concept*, i.e, a concept that is properly defined in terms of the concept of truth. Along this line, I would say that little more can be said about the nature of reality than that it is **that which makes our thoughts true or false**. My belief in this minimalist theory stems from a view of mine that I call *conceptual relativism*. Though I am an absolutist about truth in the sense that I believe that any given representation of reality is either true or false, regardless of whose mind it happens to be in, I believe that there are many possible ways other than our own way, and the ways of other actual cultures, that reality could have been conceptualized. For this reason, any more substantial theory of reality than the one I have given is bound to reflect merely our own somewhat arbitrary conceptual system. To illustrate, suppose we took reality to be that which is represented by all possible true thoughts. Even if we allowed "all possible true thoughts" to be all true thoughts expressible by all possible conceptual systems, we would still be making the false move of identifying reality with a human representation of reality.</p> <p>Though we can continue to create a rich and perfectly true *image of reality*, i.e., reality as represented by all that we take to be true, it will always be partial only, idiosyncratically reflective of human history and nature, and generally merely human, and thus we can never *identify it* in any sense with reality. All we can say about the *nature* of reality is that it is what makes our thoughts true or false. Reality will make any elaboration of this false.</p> <p>As usual, we will convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30pm.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul M. Paolini</p> <p>p.s., I will be posting the above thumbnail essay on my Facebook page for thread discussion there. Feel free to friend-request me if you'd like to join the conversation.</p> ",

"description": "<p>The topic of this meet shall be loyalty. Below is a sketch of a short essay that I wrote for the occasion. While I hope the essay inspires thought, you will not need to be a logical analyst to find our meet conversation meaningful. Our conversations are always broad-ranging, with the nuance of personal experiences.</p> <p>What is loyalty?</p> <p>What does it mean for a person to be loyal to someone or something, X? As a starting point, what is the general nature of X, that is, what is the nature of what a person can be loyal to. Though we say that we are loyal to certain people simply, certain organizations simply, our country simply, and so on, such statements are vague unless the respect in which we are loyal to such entities is made clear. To illustrate, to say that one is loyal to a person, Smith, who is both one's employer and one's friend, does not clarify whether one's loyalty to Smith is Smith as an employer or Smith as a friend or Smith as something else. This point clarifies that the X in question is a specific kind of relationship with a particular person or thing. To aid further inquiry, I shall represent what a person in general can be loyal to with the expression 'E as R', where 'E' represents the entity, i.e., person or thing, that is the object of loyalty, and 'R' represents the respect of the loyalty.</p> <p>We may now ask what it means for a person, P, to be loyal to E as R. A first point is that, whatever loyalty is, it seems that a necessary condition of P being loyal to E as R is that P values E as R. To illustrate, if a person is loyal to a company as an employer, and to a person as a spouse, it seems the person must value the company as an employer and the person as a spouse. A reason for this is that if we deny that one must value what one is loyal to, we would be forced to say that loyalty is simply a matter of how one acts, and that thought and emotions are inessential to it. But in this case, the only thing keeping a person "loyal" is, e.g., either fear or the personal benefits of acting "loyal". But it seems that a loyalty that would vanish as soon as fear lifted, or personal benefits stopped, is not true loyalty at all. Hence, loyalty entails valuing E as R.</p> <p>Given that valuing E as R is a necessary condition of being loyal to E as R, we might consider that in general loyalty is simply being in a way that is consistent with valuing E as R, i.e.:</p> <p>[1] P is loyal to E as R if and only if P's way of being is consistent with valuing E as R.</p> <p>I say 'P's way of being' rather than 'P's actions' because the latter would allow loyalty to be merely a fear- or personal-benefit-motivated way of acting, which, as mentioned earlier, would not be genuine loyalty at all.</p> <p>On the analysis [1], if P's way of being is inconsistent with valuing E as R, P is merely not loyal to E as R, which is not the same as P being disloyal to E as R. Disloyalty can only arise when a relationship of loyalty is presumed. Thus, a rough analysis of disloyalty would be:</p> <p>[2] P is disloyal to E as R if and only if it is presumed that P is loyal to E as R and P's way of being is inconsistent with valuing E as R.</p> <p>Charges of disloyalty may be said to have one of two possible implications: 1) that one is being in a way that is merely negligently inconsistent with valuing E as R, and 2) that one is not genuinely loyal to E as R, i.e., that one does not genuinely value E as R.</p> <p>Special Conditions of Loyalty</p> <p>A value of the analysis of the object of loyalty as "E as R" is that the 'R' within this indicates the needed special conditions for understanding loyalty in various kinds of relationships. To illustrate, if we wanted to know the conditions of being loyal to someone as a friend, the task would be clarified as completing the following:</p> <p>[3] P's way of being is consistent with valuing E as a friend if and only if X.</p> <p>where X is the relevant conditions.</p> <p>Conditional Loyalty</p> <p>As the objects of loyalty are certain sorts of values, i.e., particular valued relationships, it makes sense that loyalties inherit the prioritization and conditionality of values in general. To illustrate, an employee may be loyal to their company so long as this loyalty does not conflict with higher loyalties, such as loyalty to their spouse. Thus, if the company asked the employee to lie to their spouse about the nature of a project, the employee might quietly ignore this directive on the grounds that loyalty to the spouse trumps loyalty to the company.</p> <p>Is Loyalty a Virtue?</p> <p>As there is nothing praiseworthy about loyalty to morally dubious people or organizations, loyalty in and of itself is not praiseworthy. As whether loyalty is virtuous depends on what one is loyal to, loyalty in and of itself cannot be said to be a virtue.***</p> <p>As usual, we will convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>The topic of this meet shall be ethics. At minimum, our aim shall be to gain some new insights into what we are talking about when we talk about ethics. To set the stage, one way to describe ethics generally is that it is concerned with human actions with respect to the attributes of being ethical and being unethical. Being unethical is an attribute that has strong implications in contexts of human discourse in general. In any domain of life, the charge that one is acting, or has acted, unethically brings serious concern and reflection. But what does it mean for an action to be unethical?</p> <p>While in one sense, ethics is a field of philosophy concerned with the question of how we should understand the notion of ethical and unethical action, in another sense, ethics represents a general phenomenon of human rationality. Any person who feels reasonably competent in distinguishing ethical from unethical actions - which is nearly everyone - may be said to possess an ethical system, even if its principles are not consciously well-understood. Before discussing the basic types of ethical systems that ethicists have defined, let us consider three ethical puzzles that will exercise your ethical reasoning and provide case examples.</p> <p>Three Ethical Puzzles</p> <p>1) Suppose a runaway trolley car is speeding toward a group of five people who, for some reason, are not able to get off the tracks. Suppose you can save all five people by pushing the person in front of you onto the tracks, stopping the trolley car. As you save five people at the expense of one, is pushing the person the ethical thing to do?</p> <p>2) Suppose you are sitting at the beach watching three people swim around in the water. One is a family member and the other two are strangers. Suppose they all suddenly begin to drown at once, and you can save the family member only or the two stangers only. Who would you save, and how would you justify your choice ethically?</p> <p>3) Suppose you are flying in a small airplane that is bound to crash because the pilot had a fatal hear attack. There are two other passengers onboard, a pregnant woman and scientist known to be on the verge of curing a major disease. Suppose you find the one and only parachute onboard. Which of the other two would you give the parachute to, if either? Would you keep it yourself? How would you decide? Note that in this puzzle, there's the possibity of using a chance procedure, such as drawing straws, to make the decision. But is using a chance procedure an ethical way of making the decision?</p> <p>Ethical Systems</p> <p>The three basic kinds of ethical systems are consequentist systems, deontological systems and virtue systems. One way to distinguish these kinds of ethical systems is in terms of what one must consult to determine the ethical status of an action. While a consequentialist says that one must look at the consequences of an action to know whether it is ethical or unethical, a deontologists says one must look at the internal nature of the action, and the virtue ethicist says that one must look at the action in relation to human virtues.</p> <p>While consequentialist ethics and virtue ethics are relatively straight-forward in how there are supposed to work, deontological ethics requires some explanation. Perhap the best-known theism-independent instance of deontological ethics is that of Immanuel Kant. A basic principle of Kant's ethics, "the categorical imperative", says that to know whether an action is ethical or unethical, consider the general rule the action implies, and ask whether you would want everyone acting according to that rule. If your answer is "yes", the action is ethical, if your answer is "no", the action is unethical. The ethical systems of religions provide further examples of deontological ethics. If one's method of deciding cases of ethical right and wrong is to consult the authority of a religious text, for example, one is a deontologist.</p> <p>Two important versions of consequentialism are act utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism. While the former says to do the act that has the greatest utility, that is, e.g., that maximizes human well-being, rule utilitarianism says to follow the rule that fosters the greatest utility. The basic disagreement between act and rule utilitarians is whether a focus on acts or rules is what in fact maximizes utility.</p> <p>To illustrate the ethical systems mentioned above, with regard to the first puzzle above, a deontologist, a virtue ethicist and a rule utilitarian might refuse to push the person in front of the trolley on the repective grounds that direct killing is always wrong, killing is something a virtuous person never does, and a higher good may be served in a particular context by not killing even when it saves lives. If any of our ethicists are likely to push the person, it is the act utilitarian, who might say: here the choice is to save five lives at the expense of one. Do it! To this attitude, the deontologist might say that saving five people simply does not make the act of killing ethical. The rule utilitarian might be in rough agreement, saying that it is better to lose the five in question than to affirm a society in which, say, all feel vulnerable to being sacrified without notice to save someone else. I shall leave the other two ethical puzzles for you to consider in light of your own ethics and the mentioned systems, and our conclusions shall form part of our discussion at the meet. For more to read, a great starting point is the 'Consequentialism' entry on Wikipedia, which leads to many other ethics entries.</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.o" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.o</a>...</a></p> <p>As usual, we will convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>At the request of member Luke Turner, this meet will continue our discussion of ethics, however this time within the field of <i>meta-ethics</i>. As its name may suggest, meta-ethics is concerned not directly with the question of what is ethically right or wrong, but rather with the descriptive, or positive, nature of ethical theories and their prospects. To illustrate, while ethical theories are put forth as systems from which ethical judgments of actions can be derived, meta-ethics takes such theories as its subject matter. In particular, it is concerned with philosophical questions upon which the validity of entire classes of ethical theories depends. For example, questions of meta-ethics include whether ethical judgments express propositions, that is, whether they can be said to be true or false in any objective sense.</p> <p>As meta-ethics is a broad and difficult subject, I believe the best way to approach doing a meet within this subject is as follows: read the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy article on meta-ethics, linked to below, as well as anything else you find relevant, and come to the meet ready to discuss what you believe ultimately justifies the ethical claims that we make everyday, if indeed you believe they are ultimately justified.</p> <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/metaethics/"><a href="http://plato.stanford" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford</a>...</a></p> <p>As usual, we will convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and kick off the topic at 7:30.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>Our topic for this meet shall be the philosophical questions of libertariansim. As the accounts of libertarianism given by Wikipedia and the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy both commingle what may be called 'the social science of "libertarian" self-ascriptions' with surveys of philosophical theories of libertarianism, which provides but a rather obscure basis for philosophical discussion, below I have added a link to the Wikipedia entry on Robert Nozick's "Anarchy, State, and Utopia", a well-known libertarian theory, and shall now provide my take on the philosophical questions of libertarianism as a reference point for our meet conversation. I should preface this by saying that I am not necessarily an advocate of libertarianism.</p> <p>Political philosophy may be described as the ethical evaluation of possible political arrangements, especially regarding justice, which is the ethical relation of society as a whole to its members. Given this, libertarianism is, generally, a position about which possible political arrangement is most just. A first substantive point is that libertarianism is not opposed in principle to a <i>state</i>, that is, to the ordering of society by an institution with the authority to the limit freedom, and redistribute the wealth, of its citizens for the purpose of realizing collective goods; one who is opposed to states in principle is an anarchist rather than a libertarian. What libertarianism does oppose is limitations of freedom and redistributions of wealth that are not points of literal consent of the individuals compromised. The suggested priority of individual freedom, property rights and self-determination to state power, is what explains the emphasis of liberty suggested by 'libertarianism', and it is why libertarianism is associated with the notion of a minimal state. If limitations of freedom and redistributions of wealth must be points of literal consent of those compromised, then a state that institutes military, police, criminal justice and contract enforcement arrangements is likely to be the bulk of what is acceptable.</p> <p>The argument for libertarianism may be framed as an argument for the priority of liberty over state power. Here, one may argue that being coerced to live according to rules that one does not agree with is a form of oppression, at least akin to slavery, and generally unjust. As it is difficult to argue directly that the state <i>does not</i> have the right to constrain innocent individuals without literal consent, libertarian arguments tend to focus rather on the inherent rights that individuals have. While in the US it might be claimed that such rights are political rights granted by the founding documents of the US, and hence, that the US government is unconstitutional to the extent that it is not agreeable to libertarianism, the deeper philosophical argument would make a case that such rights are ethical rights, that is, rights that constrain the formation of any human state. While political rights are effectively chartered constrains on state power, ethical rights are constraints in the ways that one person, or entity, can treat another, that follow from ethical rules. As this may suggest, one way to defend libertarianism is to argue that any form of coercion within a state by the state, outside the criminal justice system, is ethically wrong. At this point, the libertarian would need to draw upon their ethics of choice to make the case. A utilitarian libertarian, for example, might argue that the relevant coercion makes humanity worse off than it would be otherwise, and hence is unethical.</p> <p>Given that libertarianism is defended in principle, its next question is that of what will be the lot of the wost off in society. That is, what will be the circumstance of those who otherwise would have been assisted by non-consentual wealth redistribution? There are three possibilities consistent with libertarianism, opt-in government charities, private charities, and the disturbing though possible view of "let them starve". Given the first two possibilities, libertarianism is not necessarily an inhumane "every man for himself" philosophy. Its central point is simply that no innocent person should be forced to live according to rules that they did not choose.</p> <p>Links to overviews:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarianism"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.o" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.o</a>...</a><br/><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/libertarianism/"><a href="http://plato.stanford" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford</a>...</a></p> <p>Anarchy, State, and Utopia:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchy,_State,_and_Utopia"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.o" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.o</a>...</a></p> <p>As usual, we will convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and kick off the discussion at 7:30.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>The topic of our first April meet shall be the problem of free will. The traditional framing of this problem is as follows: If reality is fundamentally a sequence of physical states such that each state follows its predecessor by mechanical necessity, then how is it possible that we are free to act as we wish? More narrowly, if conscious states are caused by material states, and material states flow one to the next by causal necessity, then how is it possible that conscious states do not flow one to the next by causal necessity? That is, how could conscious events involve the freedom they are ordinarily taken to have? To illustrate, suppose I am at a clothing store and after some deliberation I choose a black sweater over a blue one. Is it true, strictly speaking, that I could have chosen the blue sweater? Well, if my consciousness is merely a passenger on a thread of material causation that began with the Big Bang, then it seems my sweater choice must have been encoded in the universe at time of the Big Bang; for to deny this would seem to commit one to a suspension of physical laws at one or more points in the past.</p> <p>It may seem that a way out of the problem of free will is to hold that the causal relation between consciousness and the thread of material causation goes two ways: the material thread produces consciousness, but consciousness acts back on the material thread, allowing free will to influence the course of events. But while causation may in fact go both ways, the problem remains that any conscious state that influences the direction of the material thread must itself be determined by the material thread. So again it seems that a suspension of physical laws would be needed for any sort of freedom to enter the picture.</p> <p>A relatively recent development that some have tried to use in reconciling free will with materialism is the phenomenon of ontological randomness put forth by quantum physics. If material reality has a certain randomness on a basic level, some suppose, perhaps this explains how consciousness might not be entirely determined by the material thread. If you find this idea compelling, the following authors@google talk by Berkeley philosopher John Searle is relevant: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCyKNtocdZE"><a href="http://www.youtube.co" class="linkified">http://www.youtube.co</a>...</a></p> <p>I, and hopefully others, will post resources related to this meet in the comments section of the meet page between now and the meet. As usual, we'll convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and begin the topic at 7:30.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul M. Paolini</p> ",

Note that if the concept of free will is incoherent, it does not mean that we <i>do not have free will</i>; that notion would be incoherent too.</p> <p>Below, I post some ideas that have occurred to me since last time, and members are encouraged to post ideas and resources.</p> <p>As usual, we will convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and start the topic at 7:30.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> <p>Determined to Do as We Please</p> <p>Consider a person, P, making a choice between alternatives A and B. On thinking out the implications of both A and B, P finds B more desirable than A. P then chooses B.</p> <p>Is it a matter of P's choice whether A or B turns out to be more desirable to P? A second question: could P have chosen A, that is, the alternative that P finds less desirable?</p> <p>If we suppose that the answer to both questions above is 'no', then P's choice appears to be "determined" in a sense: P has no choice about which alternative appears as most desirable, and P must choose the most desirable alternative; thus, we might say that P had no real choice in the matter.</p> <p>Looked at another way, however, what determines P's choice is P's <i>desire</i>. Thus, we might also say that P's choice is determined by what P wants, or that P is choosing as P wants.</p> <p>Given the assumptions I've made, it seems that P's choice for B is free in the sense that it constitutes P doing what P wants to, though determined in the sense that P cannot do what P does not want to.</p> <p>Regarding our meet question, as doing what we want to appears consistent with determinism, 'free will' must mean something like freedom to do what we do not want to. ...some thoughts to ponder.</p> ",

"description": "<p>Apologies for the late notice for this meet, but co-organizer Rodrigo has framed an interesting topic for those of us who can make it. I was planning, as some may know, to do this meet on immortality, but that topic will be saved for a later date. Here's Rodrigo's topic:</p> <p>"Well, that's just like your opinion, man." -The Dude</p> <p>Our news media routinely separates facts on the front page from opinions on the editorial page. Judges issue findings of fact at the start of trials, and issue opinions at their conclusion. We are entitled to our own opinions, but not to our own facts. On matters of fact, we expect the legitimacy of answers from established authorities, whereas on matters of opinion, established authorities never seem legitimate enough.</p> <p>What are facts and what are opinions? For any given question, is whether the question is a matter of fact or opinion itself a fact or an opinion? What is the role of demonstration or proof?</p> <p>We routinely disagree on matters of opinion and think nothing of it. Can we similarly disagree on matters of fact? Are these disagreements any less sustainable?</p> <p>How do facts and opinions relate to truth and belief? Are opinions just beliefs that aren't also knowledge? Are believed facts always knowledge?</p> <p>As usual, we'll meet as 7pm, meet and greet, and begin the topic at 7:30.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul M. Paolini<br/>Rodrigo Vanegas</p> ",

"description": "<p>Nearly everyone is passionate about fiction in some form, whether this is Woody Allen films, Mamet plays, Hemingway short stories, science fiction novels, or the television show du jour. Given that we are all passionate about philosophy also, it seems a good question for the upcoming meet would be that of how the domains of fiction and philosophy are related. While we might consider any questions relevant to this topic, here are a few that I find especially interesting:</p> <p>Can works of fiction count as works of philosophy in the strictest sense? Why or why not?<br/>Is fiction a valid medium for contemporary philosophy? Why or why not?<br/>If fiction is a valid medium for developing and expressing philosophical ideas, how might it work as such? Further, what domains of philosophy might this medium be most fruitful in?</p> <p>Some online resources on the topic. All fascinating, especially the Murdoch interview.</p> <p>A paper by Margaret G. Holland taking exception to Martha Nussbaum's claim that some works of literary fiction are works of moral philosophy.<br/><a href="http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Lite/LiteHoll.htm"><a href="http://www.bu.edu/wcp" class="linkified">http://www.bu.edu/wcp</a>...</a></p> <p>A "Philosophy Talk" episode wherein an analytic philosopher/novelist is interviewed.<br/><a href="http://www.philosophytalk.org/pastShows/PhilFiction.html"><a href="http://www.philosophy" class="linkified">http://www.philosophy</a>...</a></p> <p>A Brian Magee interview with philosopher-novelist Iris Murdoch.<br/><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m47A0AmqxQE"><a href="http://www.youtube.co" class="linkified">http://www.youtube.co</a>...</a></p> <p>As usual, we'll convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and start the topic when we're settled in.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul M.

"description": "<p>The topic for this meet shall be causality, which is a notion that is at least relevant to perhaps all major philosophical problems. In framing questions for the meet, an initial point of clarification is the distinction between causal generalities, which may be expressed 'A causes B', and causal instances, which may be expressed 'a caused b'. Note that all actual instances of causation, holding among particular actual entities, are in the present or the past. With this distinction, we may note that it is only in virtue of the nature of actual instances of causation that causal generalizations, which often involve the (usually) epistemic notion of probability, have any connection to reality. Though we may consider questions about the nature of causal generalizations, these points allow focusing some questions upon the nature of causal instances. In particular, suppose it is true that a caused b, what sorts of entities might a and b be? To explore this, consider some ordinary sentences of the form 'a caused b':</p> <p>[1] The billiard ball striking the other caused the other to move.<br/>[2] Bill's pushing the button caused the piano to rise.<br/>[3] The wind caused the water to ripple.</p> <p>Note that 'caused' does not appear to relate discrete entities, or objects, such as tables and chairs. That is, it appears that 'a' and 'b' in 'a caused b' must refer to something other than the objects involved in the relation. In particular, it seems that what 'caused' relates is whatever expressions like 'Bill's pushing the button' pick out in the world. But what do these sorts of expressions pick out? Events? Changes? If so, what are these? This shall be one of our questions.</p> <p>Whatever the nature of the relata of the 'caused' relation, it appears to be the case that such relata exist in more than one ontological domain. In particular, while we say that material things like billiard balls and pianos engage in causal relations, we say that things like beliefs, desires, intents, emotions and perceptions, engage in causal relations as well, among themselves, as well as with entities in the material domain. For example, we say things like:</p> <p>[4] (Believing that she got the job) caused (her to be happy).<br/>[5] (Believing that it was the best of its kind) caused (him to desire it).<br/>[6] Seeing the bear caused her to run.<br/>[7] His distraction with the radio caused the car to drift off the road.</p> <p>Given the above points, we might ask whether 'caused' means the same thing regardless of the kinds of entities engaged in the relation or whether it may mean different things depending on the kinds of entities involved. In short, is there one 'caused' relation or many? This shall be another of our questions.</p> <p>A third area of questions we might consider is that of the truth conditions of statements of the form 'a caused b'. (Of course, if 'cause' has more than one sense, these statements may have more than one set of truth conditions). To suggest what this question asks, suppose that seeing a bear is what caused you to run, but someone who agrees both that you saw a bear and that you ran denies that it was seeing the bear that caused you to run. How would you respond? You might say that if you hadn't seen the bear you wouldn't have run, thus it is the cause; but is this sort of logical dependence all that is required to make statements of the form 'a caused b' true?</p> <p>Reading:<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.o" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.o</a>...</a><br/><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-process/"><a href="http://plato.stanford" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford</a>...</a></p> <p>As usual, we'll convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and start the topic when we're settled in.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul M.

"description": "<p>Hermeneutics may be described as a tradition of thought, going back at least to St. Augustine, that began as an approach to interpreting and authenticating texts (sacred and secular) and subsequently developed into a comprehensive philosophical orientation in its own right, with semiotics, structuralism and deconstruction among its more or less specifically philosophical manifestations.</p> <p>The main reading for this meet shall be the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on hermeneutics, <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hermeneutics/"><a href="http://plato.stanford" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford</a>...</a>, though broader reading is encouraged. The question we shall consider pertains to the claim:</p> <p>To understand oneself is thus to understand the genealogy of one's own intellectual horizon.</p> <p>which comes from a paragraph, posted below, from the S.E.P. article. At the meet, we shall discuss what this claim means and whether we think it is true, and what it means to ask what the claim means and whether it is true.</p> <p>As usual, we'll convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and start the topic when we're settled in.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul M. Paolini</p> <p>Coming from a very different tradition, Giambattisto Vico, the author of the <i>Scienza nuova</i> (1725), is another central figure in the development of early modern hermeneutics. Speaking out against the Cartesianism of his time, Vico argues that thinking is always rooted in a given cultural context. This context is historically developed, and, moreover, intrinsically related to ordinary language, evolving from the stage of myth and poetry to the later phases of theoretical abstraction and technical vocabularies. To understand oneself is thus to understand the genealogy of one's own intellectual horizon. This grants a new urgency to the historical sciences. Moreover, it offers a model of truth and objectivity that differs from those entertained by the natural sciences. The historian does not encounter a field of idealized and putatively subject-independent objects, but investigates a world that is, fundamentally, her own. There is no clear distinction between the scientist and the object of her studies. Understanding and self-understanding cannot be kept apart. Self-understanding does not culminate in law-like propositions. Appealing to tact and common sense, it is oriented towards who we are, living, as we do, within a given historical context of practice and understanding.</p> ",

"description": "<p>The general focus of our last meet (Hermeneutics) was the statement:</p> <p>To understand oneself is thus to understand the genealogy of one's own intellectual horizon.</p> <p>While our conversation went far on the notion of the genealogy of one's intellectual horizon, it did not go far on the notion of understanding oneself. For this meet, I propose that we focus on the notion of self understanding - in an open way that is not necessarily linked to hermeneutics or our discussion last time generally.</p> <p>Three questions we might consider regarding self understanding are:</p> <p>[1] What is self understanding?<br/>[2] Given that there is something that is self understanding, should it be valued?<br/>[3] If self understanding should be valued, why?</p> <p>Regarding the first question, we might ask what it is that a person with self understanding understands as such, or how a person with high self understanding differs from a person with low self understanding. An outcome in these considerations might be that while the expression 'self understanding' has a few coherent uses, there is no general inherent condition of a person that we should deem self understanding or the lack thereof.</p> <p>But given that the notion of self understanding is coherent, it might be asked how important it is as a value, if it is a value at all. To illustrate, while self understanding is something that a person might be concerned to develop, perhaps it represents merely a kind of self absorption that undermines such other potential values as being flexible, cooperative and outwardly focused. Generally, is self understanding something we should be concerned to cultivate, or merely something to consider when a problem arises, if even then?</p> <p>If it is sensed that self understanding is something to be valued and cultivated, it might be asked why this is, what specific values it realizes, for example.</p> <p>This is a topic that we can bring our everyday philosophizing to.</p> <p>As usual, we'll convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and start the topic when we're settled in.

"description": "<p>At our last meet on self understanding, it seemed to me that our conversation often drifted to the topic of identity--in the sense of "who a person is"--a topic that is clearly closely related. For this meet I propose we examine this notion of identity more directly. In particular, let us consider the questions:</p> <p>[1] What does a person's identity consist in?<br/>[2] What does it mean to say that a person's identity consists in this?</p> <p>I assume that the intuitive notion of identity that we are concerned with is fairly clear; it is the sense of 'identity' that we use when we talk about identity politics, identity crises and what is important to, or definitive of, ourselves. With regard to this intuitive notion, my two questions represent a kind of strategy for probing into what we are talking about in these cases. If it is believe there are better questions to ask, this can be a topic of conversation as well.</p> <p>Though our interest is more general than identity politics, the Stanford Encyclopedia entry contains a number of relevant ideas: <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/identity-politics/"><a href="http://plato.stanford" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford</a>...</a></p> <p>As usual, we'll convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and start the topic when we're settled in.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul M.

"description": "<p>For this meet, I propose that we discuss the notion of authenticity--a notion related to our recent topics of identity and self understanding. The philosophical topic of authenticity concerns the difference between when one's life accords with, or reflects, one's beliefs, values and desires, and when it does not. Memories of school letting out for the summer might provide for many an example of what a rush of authenticity is (supposedly) like. If school days were perceived as boring, inane and filled with tedious involuntary social relationships, while summer is perceived as a time to read and think about what one really wants to, and to associate only with who one really wants to, then one might hold that during school one was forced to play a phony role, live a phony life, while during summer one can be one's true self.</p> <p>One of the areas of philosophy in which authenticity is an important notion is political philosophy. In philosophical thought about the conditions of a just political state, the opportunity for citizens to develop, and live consistently with, their own lights--the right to pursue happiness--is often held to be a fundamental such condition.</p> <p>But that the notion of authenticity is sound is not entirely clear. In particular, is the condition of authentic living really just the condition of being free to do as one pleases? If not, how does it differ? Further, even when a person is living in circumstances that are less than desirable cannot that person's response to their situation be said to be authentic?--that is, perhaps there is no inauthentic condition, only the authentic condition in better and worse circumstances? Finally, suppose that the notion of authenticity is sound given that the notion of a true self is sound; what is a true self? It might be considered that the notion of a true self can be reduced to what one genuinely believes and values; but under what conditions are beliefs and values genuine? These are some of the questions we might consider in our discussion of authenticity.

"description": "<p>The topic for this meet shall be memory, and its cognate notions, such as forgetting, not remembering, misremembering, reminding, and forgetting.</p> <p>A working definition of memory might be that it is the ability of mind to form mental representations of past experiences, or reality. It appears that all aspects of a past experience are potentially available to memory's representations; that is, all modalities of perception can be remembered, as can past thoughts and emotions. To illustrate, suppose yesterday I visited a red windmill in a grassy field. Thanks to my memory, today I can form mental representations of nearly any aspect of that experience that I wish to--as if that experience were fixed forever in time and I can now go back mentally and visit it: revisiting the way the windmill looked against the sky, the way the grass smelled, the sound of the windmill's blades turning, that I was thinking about lunch, and that I was feeling at peace. However, I might not be able to remember how many blades the windmill had, or whether there were any clouds in the sky, or whether there were any grasshoppers in the grass.</p> <p>All well and good, but one might ask: what is philosophical about memory?--isn't it something about which the brain sciences and psychology can tell us nearly all that is interesting? Well, that is a fine first philosophical question about memory.</p> <p>While one might speak as if memory were some sort of discrete component of the brain which we experience the operation of, 'memory', at least as ordinarily used, represents an introspective concept; that is, it represents a concept of a phenomenon that we know directly only through introspection, i.e, subjectively. What this means is that the identification of a part of the brain as "memory", in the ordinary sense, is valid only to the extent that that part of the brain implements what we ordinarily mean by 'memory'; note if science claims to use 'memory' in a special sense, then science isn't talking about what we mean by memory. The point of this distinction--which might seem a bit fussy--is to provide part of an explanation for the view that memory is initially a philosophical topic: we must understand how the concept of memory fits logically and definitionally within the broader ancestral system of introspective concepts that orient us in ordinary life before we can understand scientifically how memory in the ordinary sense is implemented by the brain--if that is even a coherent project (Why should we expect a close correspondence between age-old ordinary concepts and brain operation? Such concepts are bound to reflect operations of the brain, but are they not bound to reflect much else besides? The purpose, in a manner of speaking, of the ordinary concept of memory is to help orient us in experience, not to understand brain physiology.)--and psychology can tells us how well, poorly or idiosyncratically, humans remember. This is my view on the relation of science to the topic of memory--one which may of course be discussed and countered at the meet--and below, as I frame a few more specific questions about memory, I believe this view will be clarified, perhaps even bolstered.</p> <p>Returning to the windmill that I visited yesterday, I do not remember how many blades the windmill had, but did I forget how many blades it had? Is not remembering the same as forgetting? Well, if someone asked me how many blades the windmill had, and I said that I do not remember, and they said "So, you forgot, huh?" I would say that I did not forget because I did not try to remember. Is a past intent to remember a necessary condition of forgetting? In one sense of 'forget', perhaps, but there is second sense of 'forget' in which one succeeds only if one succeeds in not remembering. This is the sense used when I say that I wish to forget that I ever saw that windmill. While, in the first sense, forgetting is the failure of a past intent to remember, in the second sense it is a present intent not to remember in the future. So, as forgetting can be a failure to remember, remembering can be a failure to forget.</p> <p>The above reflections suggest how memory concepts are integrated logically and definitionally with other families of introspective concepts, such as that represented by the concept of intent. To go further in this direction, we might ask how memory is related to belief. What's the difference between my remembering that I saw a windmill yesterday and my believing that I saw a windmill yesterday? Here I will point out that generally while memory is transformable (e.g. in my memory of the windmill I can move my attention around within the remembered past experience continuously, seeing different angles, focusing on sound, then on emotion, etc.) and perceptual (e.g., remembering a sound is in some respects like actually hearing one), belief appears rather static and aperceptual if one thinks about it. With regard to the difference between remembering that X and believing that X, however, the general differences may be less important than the logic of claims to these respective states: remembering that X implies believing that X, but it says more: it says also that one has a memory of X, which distinguishes X from experiences one believes oneself to have had but does not have a memory of.</p> <p>It is also interesting to consider the relation between memory and imagination. Suppose that when I visited the windmill, I viewed it only from the east side. When today I make a large circle around the windmill in my mind, seeing it from all 360 degrees, to what extent am I remembering as opposed to imagining? I shall leave this question for the meet. Another question: as the windmill was red, what is the difference between imaging the windmill as red and simply remembering it as such? To explain, within my imagination I can make the windmill any color I want, including the color that it actually is, but in the case that I imagine the windmill as the color that it actually is, how does this mental state differ from simply remembering the windmill? The purpose of this odd question is to seek a difference between memory and imagination that is deeper than one in terms of accurate representation of reality.</p> <p>Speaking of reality, it appears that the concepts of memory and reality are importantly related. Certainly, representing past reality is a condition of being a genuine memory, but what does it mean for a supposed memory, or anything for that matter, to represent past reality?</p> <p>I will add that I know that memory in certain senses has been a theme of special interest in literary fiction. If anyone is familiar with this theme, such knowledge would be a fine resource for our discussion.</p> <p>As usual, my discussion above is just a reference point for discussion at the meet of whatever we find compelling with regard to the general topic. I encourage reading whatever you find interesting and relevant, including relevant Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Wikipedia entries.</p> <p>And as usual we'll convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and start the topic when we're settled in.</p> <p>Best,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>For this meet, member David Shalen is our guest topic-framer and slated co-moderator. In his essay below, David raises questions concerning the nature of ethical and aesthetic values and how such values coexist. Additional reading on the topic is open and encouraged. As usual, we'll convene at 7pm and start the discussion when we're settled in. Cheers, Paul</p> <p>Does Aesthetics Come at the Expense of Ethics? by David Shalen</p> <p>The problem of the relationship between ethics and aesthetics has troubled philosophy since its inception and humanity longer. It has spawned almost as many questions as theories to address those questions, but the question raised here is a recurring one. Put more precisely, it is the question of whether following one's aesthetic bliss, whether through creation or appreciation of arts and aesthetic artifacts, hinder's one's tendency to follow one's own ethical concerns, whatever precise form those happen to take. The conflict is most clearly visible in the context that has likely generated most of the concern over human history, the context of weighing aesthetic and ethical considerations in making a decision. But it is not and cannot be limited to questions that arise in individual decisions.</p> <p>In considering the reasons for taking or not taking any course of actions, we often weigh the aesthetic and ethical effects of the actions. For example, in deciding whether to buy a beautiful rug made by poorly paid laborers, someone might compare their desire to have a well-appointed living room with their desire to help end an abusive institution. (It is assumed here that the subject's economic theory accomodates this framing of the decision.) But, supposing that the decision is made against buying the rug on ethical grounds, in what sense can it be said that the aesthetic pleasure of the individual has been diminished by the action? In all likelihood, the individual's aesthetics concerning his living room were themselves changed by the ethical dimension of his purchasing decision. As we all know from similar experiences, the apparent beauty of the rug in one's living room, the subjective sentiment at the heart of the aesthetics in the situation, can easily be altered by becoming conscious of some other consideration. It would be easy to conclude from the fact that we weigh the two dissimilar considerations against each other in making a decision that each comes at the expense of the other if they remained independent of each other throughout a decision-making process. This they clearly need not; if ethics can alter aesthetics as it comes up, it need not be said that aesthetics in general comes at the expense of ethics, but only that following a particular aesthetic unconditionally would indeed trump all other considerations, including ethical ones.</p> <p>Neither the idea of following an aesthetic unconditionally or contrastingly letting ethical considerations change it are particularly well-defined without a saying what an aesthetic is or describing its internal development in a theoretical environment free of other considerations, which space does not permit me to delve into here. We do however know that whatever the definitions or descriptions might be, the topic remains obtuse and theoretical, since, ordinarily, people do not follow aesthetic considerations in a vacuum. The aesthetic dimension of life loses all meaning if it is subject to a rule that no considerations that are not properly aesthetic can change them, simply because it would then become completely random with regard to life's other dimensions. This entails that any particular aesthetic judgement must be subject to being changed by life's other concerns to be a valid criterion of judgment at all. Likewise ethical judgments refer to other considerations almost by definition; people are to be protected by ethical behavior so that they may enjoy life's pleasures, including aesthetic pleasures which we must assume are at least somewhat akin to ours.</p> <p>While it might thus be argued that all dimensions of judgement by nature exist to promote each other, the fact remains that in making a specific decision, we often weigh one consideration against another. And both ethics and aesthetics, while we freely speak of them as stable general dimensions of judgment, seem to exist only within the context of actual decisions. Our discussion of some real or ideal person's ethics or aesthetics are almost epiphenomenal to what they discuss. To make statements about what is ethical behavior in general is to be insensitive to the particular facts about a situation, while to speak of making decisions promoting aesthetic excellence in general is to suppose that one's tastes are shared with all others and will never change. In other words, the two criteria seem to require a situation to be handed down to them to make sense at all, and that situation includes both the tastes of the people involved and the likely effect of their actions on others. The famous conflict between ethics and aesthetics seems insoluble in the context of a particular decision; given two people of like aesthetics at the outset of a potential rug purchase, it is highly likely that one will follow, and the other ignore, his conscience concerning the condition of the rug weavers. How can we avoid saying that one has let his aesthetics trump his ethics, while the other has not?</p> <p>Perhaps we cannot, but we can ask in return if the refrainer has not succeeded in making his overall aesthetic experience of life richer by being willing to change it in response to ethical circumstances, which will likely cause him to have a larger range of aesthetic experiences in his life. This very control of the range of aesthetic experience by factors which are not themselves aesthetic may in fact be what makes talk of a real or ideal individual's general aesthetic more than a set of epiphenomenal after-the-fact remarks. Thus, if by aesthetic bliss we are to mean something other than instant gratification, in defining it we might very well want to consider an individual's aesthetic through an extended period rather than statically. If the history of humanity provides any analogy to this life course, a visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art (or a combination of San Francisco Museums) would convince us that ethics in general enlivens aesthetics; the great diversity of art in the museum is very heavily inspired by the evolving ethical concerns of the societies that produced it. Most of us grasp this concept so well that we are in fact prone to exaggerate this ethical history by ignoring the equally crucial technical developments that permitted the evolution witnessed in such a collection. Yet it is difficult for us to understand the interplay between aesthetics and ethics dynamically rather than statically outside the context of art history or some other narrow discipline. Again, if we cannot explain our aesthetic development without also explaining much about our ethical development, how and why should every episode of this development treat ethics and aesthetics as independent entities often in conflict with each other? A possible simple answer states that following one's aesthetic bliss is not the way to promote it, but this seems like a draconian maxim that would rob life of its' aesthetic character if t aken literally. More subtle answers must be possible, since we humans have almost always made more subtle decisions concerning the ethical and aesthetic dimensions of life. ***</p> ",

"description": "<p>In proposing a meet on "the supernatural," I do not necessarily have in mind a meet of exchanging ghost stories, reading minds and telling fortunes (as fun as that might be). I have in mind, rather, something we like even better: the more dry and abstract consideration of what <i>the supernatural</i> is supposed to be.</p> <p>Whatever one's attitude toward the supernatural, it is a force to be reckoned with in making philosophically-responsible sense of such notions as <i>nature</i> and <i>reality</i>. In particular, as supernatural phenomena is logically possible, a sound definition of, e.g., <i>nature</i>, would have to be neutral to such questions as that of whether God exists. Realizing such neutrality requires understanding the ontological realm in which God and other such ostensively-supernatural beings would exist.</p> <p>The main reading for this meet is an essay by someone named Paul Almond. The essay seeks to demonstrate that the notion of the supernatural has no coherent meaning.

"description": "<p>The general area of this topic was suggested by member Greg M.</p> <p>We distinguish people we merely <i>know of</i> (people we merely know to exist) from people we are <i>acquainted</i> with (people we have at least <i>met</i>, say). And, from both of these, we distinguish people we claim to <i>know</i>. Familiar expressions for drawing these distinctions include:</p> <p>I've met her but I don't know her.<br/>I know of him but I don't know him.<br/>I know of her but I've never met her.</p> <p>But what do we mean when we claim to know someone? Is there, with regard to each person, a set of facts such that to know those facts is to know that person? If so, it seems that it could be correct to say that we <i>know</i> a past person, such as Plato, in the same sense that we know our friends. But as there would be something odd in a present person counting Plato among the people he knows--regardless of how much he knows about Plato--it seems there's more to knowing people than knowing facts about them.</p> <p>While the notion of acquaintance might now be explored as the needed further component of knowing someone, let us first frame some questions regarding the factual component. While knowing a certain set of facts about a person is not, we suspect, all there is knowing someone, it is certainly <i>part</i> of knowing someone: to deny this would be to claim that it is possible to know someone without knowing anything about them. So, we may consider that knowing what it means to know someone consists in part in knowing the nature of the facts involved in knowing someone. In particular, when we know someone, what sorts of things do we know about them?--their history, their circumstances, their aspirations, their psychological make-up? Is knowing certain sorts of facts about a person necessary to knowing the person, or are instances of people knowing each other connected only by "family resemblance"--that is, no essence, only a changing thread of commonalities?</p> <p>So it appears that knowing someone has a factual knowledge component as well as perhaps some kind of acquaintance component. Though being acquainted with someone may seem like a simple enough notion, reflection reveals it to be perhaps more difficult than the knowledge component. To illustrate, suppose someone knows more about a certain famous person than she knows about her friends; further suppose that this person has the opportunity to meet the famous person: how must that initial meeting develop in order for the person to say truly that she knows the famous person. Clearly, she could not say it if the famous person forgot the meeting immediately afterward. As this suggests, it seems there must be a reciprocity of awareness of existence for one person to know another. So let us suppose the person is remembered forever by the famous person, so that if she, e.g., ran into the famous person on the street, the latter would recognize the former as a person met. Could she now say she knows the famous person? If not, what's missing? Is it the case that people must have a certain social proximity, or connectedness, at least at some point, to say that they know each other? If so, perhaps this is a third component of knowing someone.</p> <p>So the general question of the meet is that of what it means to know someone; and, as usual, the thoughts I present here are just one voice on the matter. I have yet to find relevant readings. If members have reading suggestions, let me know or post them on the site. But, as usual, readings or not, I'm sure we'll have a good conversation.</p> <p>Note that I've changed the start time of the meet to 7:30. We'll convene then, meet and greet, and start the conversation when we're settled in. Also note that if we're not in our usual room, we'll be on the back patio.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>For this meet, I propose that we discuss philosophical questions raised by "neurocinematics," a newer field chartered to be a union of cognitive neuroscience and cinema studies.</p> <p>Before turning to questions, let us consider what neurocinematics is, or claims to be. Here's a paper by seminal researchers in neurocinematics: <a href="http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Gf2SCcsCnqMJ:weblamp.princeton.edu/~psych/psychology/research/hasson/pubs/Hasson_Neurocinematics_2008.pdf+neurocinematics&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjkHH7wsDmOF07fb-ZKIyu5LurWol8_N8lK9cWavyUrCoxx2r6kwwd3PpnLCtJFFyubTCnzvVzKqdXm7kqzObivoGl-Z5q5K8hh7vy_8zX9tXMt4vWWzsyqq1xxrmwhODdDAjyj&amp;sig=AHIEtbS1H0gZ0oBlRRuFjyGykpnUctYKbw"><a href="http://docs.google.co" class="linkified">http://docs.google.co</a>...</a></p> <p>The above paper is modest about what neurocinematics entails and is respectful of the (supposed) intrinsically artistic aspect of filmmaking; it allows that neurocinematics might be merely the use of neuroscience to achieve more engaging film direction and editing. Here, however, is a bit of (humorous/sarcastic) cynicism on this point: <a href="http://futurismic.com/2010/02/10/neurocinematics/"><a href="http://futurismic.com" class="linkified">http://futurismic.com</a>...</a></p> <p>Suggested by this (sarcastic) article is that neurocinematics represents a reduction of cinema studies (or the artistry of film) to brain science. While this seems rather extreme, it is not far-fetched to imagine scientists seeking to develop a neuroscientific theory of what makes a film good in the fullest sense. Traditional notions of film theory, such as plot and character, could be defined to link up with measurable neuroscientific concepts, and through trials of cinematic permutations on fMRI-wired audience members, research could grow that would support the making of movies that are not only good, but objectively, scientifically good.</p> <p>But is lighting up neural pleasure centers all there is to a good film? If not, what else could be essential? Might it be the case that some communion with an artistic agency behind a film is essential to the film being meaningful, and thus to its being good? As a thought experiment, could a film generated by a computer according to neurocinematic data be meaningful? If so, what would it mean for the film to be meaningful given that we are not really being communicated to by anyone?</p> <p>That neurocinematics represents anything so extreme, however, is just one possibility. If there is a way in which neuroscience and traditional cinema studies could dovetail such that artistic integrity would not be a concern, how might this work?</p> <p>As a final question, suppose the overt facts established by neurocinematics were perfectly sound in themselves; would this mean that neurocinematics is immune to any criticism of being misguided?</p> <p>As usual, we'll convene at 7pm, meet and greet, and start the topic when we're settled in.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>For this meet, which will be the first at our new venue and new time, I propose that we discuss the nature of concepts, and, as a secondary topic, the significance of concepts to philosophy as a form of inquiry. Regarding concepts, I pose two questions:</p> <p>[1] What are concepts?<br/>[2] What kinds of concepts are there?</p> <p>To get thought going on these questions I've posted two links below. The first is to SEP's well-done, extensive entry on concepts; the second is to this website's message board where I've posted the first part of an in-progress essay by me on concepts.</p> <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/"><a href="http://plato.stanford" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford</a>...</a><br/><a href="http://www.meetup.com/philosophy-184/messages/boards/thread/10074584"><a href="http://www.meetup.com" class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com</a>...</a></p> <p>The second part of our topic concerns the relation of concepts to philosophy. For many philosophers--especially analytic philosophers--concepts are central to the definition of what philosophy is about. Here's a link to a (relatively-light) article in which a philosopher, Oxford don Peter Hacker, expresses just such a view:</p> <p><a href="http://www.philosophypress.co.uk/?p=1583"><a href="http://www.philosophy" class="linkified">http://www.philosophy</a>...</a></p> <p>How important are concepts to your conception of philosophy? Do you believe that philosophy by nature is about the analysis of concepts (in some sense) or do you believe it is most centrally about something else? The following link to the Wikipedia entry on metaphilosophy may be a resource on these questions.<br/><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphilosophy"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.o" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.o</a>...</a></p> <p>We'll convene at our new venue at 2pm, meet and greet, and start the topic when we're settled in. As usual with our meets, things go best when everyone comes on time, but later arrivals by those who <i>must</i> be late are fine.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>Hi everyone - I wasn't going to schedule another meeting until January, as members tend to be out of town, or concerned with other things, during the holidays, but a member from another part of the globe contacted me lamenting that no meet was scheduled during his holiday visit to the Bay Area, so why not throw together an impromptu, mid-holiday meet at our festive former venue, Murphy's?</p> <p>I tried to think of a topic that bore traces of the season, but could find none that seemed especially compelling, so I went with the holiday-independent topic of platonism about abstract entities.</p> <p>Platonism about abstract entities, which is called such because it can be seen as a descendant of Plato's Theory of the Forms, is a position, or range of positions, about the nature of the sorts of entities we might pre-theoretically deem to be abstract objects: e.g., numbers, sets, properties, and propositions. On the one hand, platonism is intuitive in that it's the position we would hold if we took the way we ordinarily talk about abstract entities as the literal truth. For example, we speak as if the number 5 is something that exists independently of any particular human mind, that is unique, and that is such that when two people think about it they are thinking about the <b>same</b> entity. On the other hand, platonism is counter-intuitive in that people tend to find the farther implications of our ordinary speech about abstract entities to be bizarre, at least initially: if two people really think about the <b>same</b> entity when they think about the number 5, then the number 5 cannot be something within the mind of either of those two people--or within the minds of any people; thus, the number 5 must exist independently of human minds. So where and how does the number 5 exist if it does not exist in human minds? As we do not take the number 5 to have any locating spatial or temporal properties--i.e., it is absurd to think that it is located somewhere spatially, and given its independence of human minds, there is no reason to think it came into being, or will pass out of being, with human minds--it seems it must exist in a realm outside space and time--or outside space, and eternal; and this is what platonists about abstract entities believe: abstract entities are (spatio-temporally) transcendent, mind-independent entities that human minds just happen to be able to grasp and study.</p> <p>One response to platonism is that talk about two people thinking about the <b>same</b> abstract entity is just a manner of speaking. However, some platonists claim to be platonists not because they find the view intuitively appealing, but because they find the theories that try to explain how such talk of sameness is just a manner of speaking even less plausible.</p> <p>The question of this meet shall be whether or not and why or why not you find platonism plausible. Those who do not find it plausible might discuss their alternative views; those who do find it plausible might discuss what they find wrong in its alternatives. Here is a relatively thorough, SEP entry on platonism:</p> <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism/"><a href="http://plato.stanford" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford</a>...</a></p> <p>Please read as much as you can if you plan to attend.</p> <p>We'll meet at 7pm, meet and greet, and start the topic when we're settled in.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>Rene Descartes (1596-1650) was a non-academic French thinker who made important and original contributions in the histories of contemporary mathematics, physics and philosophy, among other fields. His works of greatest interest to philosophers are <i>Discourse on Method</i> (1637) and <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i> (1641). While the <i>Discourse</i> is a relatively austere reflection on the nature and grounds of certainty in human knowledge, involving the famous statement, "I think; therefore I am," the <i>Meditations</i> is a more elaborate consideration of the same themes, along with new ones, in the form of six meditations presented as daily meditations over six successive days. In the files section of this website, PDF files of both of these relatively short texts may be found.</p> <p> </p> <p>At this meeting, the first of our seminar-format meetings, we will consider Descartes' epistemology as it is present in the <i>Discourse</i>. Generally speaking, one's epistemology is one's set of views on the nature, status, sources, prospects, and so on, of human knowledge. In particular, an epistemology may be conceived as giving answers to such questions as:</p> <p> </p> <p>+Under what conditions can something be said to be known as opposed to merely believed?</p> <p>+To what extent is one's knowledge conditioned by human nature and one's culture?</p> <p>+What is the right way to go about attaining knowledge?</p> <p> </p> <p>In the <i>Discourse</i>, Descartes has things to say on questions like these that are not only fascinating in themselves but turning points in the history of philosophy. A favorite point of mine is Descartes' likening the state of knowledge in his day to an old European city with erratic streets and hodgepodge buildings. While such may bring charm to a city, Descartes suggests, its analogue in knowledge should be rebuilt in a logical way on certainty. This project is generally what the <i>Discourse</i> is about.</p> <p> </p> <p>At the meeting, I will give a short talk--around thirty minutes--concerning what I find interesting in Descartes epistemology and framing some general topics for discussion. After this, there will be around ninety minutes of discussion on the framed topics, or whatever relevant we wish to discuss.</p> <p> </p> <p>While reading the <i>Discourse</i> is optional for attendance--though at least looking the text over is encouraged--being on time is important because the basis of the discussion with this kind of meeting is set at the beginning.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul M. Paolini</p> ",

"description": "<p>People often have wishes for what will be the case in some regard after they die; and they sometimes institute these wishes through making contracts with, receiving promises from, and making requests to, others that they expect to live on after them.  For example, an elderly person might promise to leave a house to a friend on the condition that the friend promises to maintain the house's valuable, long-cultivated garden; or the elderly person might simply ask the friend to promise to maintain the garden, or simply request such in a will, such that no promise is made.</p> <p> </p> <p>I shall use the word 'legacy' in one of its narrower senses to mean any contractual or non-contractual promise received from the living by the dead, or any request made by the dead to the living.  Given this, we may distinguish <i>contract legacies</i>, where the living has a contract with the dead, <i>promise legacies</i>, where the living has made a promise to the dead, and <i>request legacies</i>, where the dead has made a request to the living.  I shall assume that contract legacies are mere ethical contracts in that while they may bind the living ethically, they do not bind them legally.  (Note that contracts by nature are ethical arrangements before they are  documents drafted by attorneys; legal contracts, which I believe cannot include what I call 'contract legacies'--are simply those contracts that are enforceable by law.)</p> <p> </p> <p>While the living might honor legacies--keep promises and fulfill requests--simply out of love or affection for the dead, how do we understand such activity in terms of ethics and rationality? Here, my interest is not in being skeptical or disrespectful of honoring legacies, but rather to raise such interesting, and possibly enlightening, questions as:</p> <p> </p> <p>[1] What is the ethical significance of not honoring a legacy?</p> <p>[2] Is it rational to honor legacies? If so, how?</p> <p> </p> <p>These questions might differ in significance depending on whether or not one believes in immortal souls.  If one does believe in them, and there is a sense in which a dead person is still a live being with interests that may be realized or frustrated, then one set of concerns arises; however, if one does not believe in them, and the dead person is assumed no longer to exist, the concerns that arise might be entirely different. </p> <p> </p> <p>As a suggestion as to what might be interesting about the above questions, if we think of ethics as relating to the well-being of others, how do we understand cases in which the person we might be concerned about being unethical to no longer exists?  Is it rational to be concerned about the interests of a person who no longers exists?  Given that honoring legacies makes perfect intuitive sense, how is this?</p> <p> </p> <p>I pose questions [1] and [2], above, for our upcoming topic-discussion meeting.  Those attending please give the questions some thought, and to come to the meeting ready to discuss your conclusions. Note that each question should be considered with regard to the three kinds of legacies I mentioned--contract, promise, and request--as each question may have different answers depending on the kind of legacy in question. I look forward to hearing what we have to say.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul M. Paolini</p> ",

"description": "<p>Metaphilosophy--the philosophy of philosophy as its name suggests--has as its basic question, 'What is philosophy?'.  While even some well-known philosophers regard the question, 'What is philosophy?', as too nebulous or difficult to take seriously, my view is that the question isn't necessarily especially difficult if approached the right way, and even if it were especially difficult, the value of any progress made would be worth the difficulty. I make the latter point because I believe that understanding what philosophy is transforms it from a mere confusing array of complex topics to a special mode of inquiry that one can apply as it suits one's interests. In sum, metaphilosophy is the topic that clarifies what philosophy is all about.</p> <p> </p> <p>The general idea for this meeting is to discuss our conceptions of what philosophy is.  We might discuss the ways philosophy differs from science, if it does differ; what philosophy's method consists in, if it has a method; whether philosophy has its own special ground of truth, if there such a thing as truth; and other things.</p> <p> </p> <p>To help with this discussion, I post the readings below.  The first is an essay by me that develops the view that philosophy is the logical examination of belief; the second is a more general discussion of what philosophy is by a philosophy professor; the third is the Wikipedia entry on metaphilosophy.</p> <p><a href="http://www.pmpaolini.com/philosophy.php"> <a href="http://www.pmpaolini.com/philosophy.php" class="linkified">http://www.pmpaolini.com/philosophy.php</a></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~phil/whatis/wsa.html"><a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~phil/whatis/wsa.html" class="linkified">http://www.dartmouth.edu/~phil/whatis/wsa.html</a><br/></a></p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphilosophy"> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphilosophy" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphilosophy</a></a></p> <p> </p> <p>I look forward to the discussion.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul M.

"description": "<p>"The world is the totality of facts, not of things."</p> <p>-(the early) Wittgenstein, Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, 1.1</p> <p> </p> <p>In ordinary language, the word 'fact' is usually used in its epistemic sense, wherein saying that Q is a fact is at least roughly equivalent to saying that Q is beyond reasonable doubt, and thus more certain than a (mere) theory, an opinion, or a guess.  Examples of what we ordinarily take to be facts in this sense include that the earth in spherical, that the earth orbits the sun, and that five plus seven equals twelve.</p> <p> </p> <p>The word 'fact' also has a metaphysical sense.  In this sense, a fact is something that relates in some way to the composition of reality, as opposed our knowledge of such. The value of this sense of 'fact' is that it allows talking about reality, or factuality, in a general way that goes beyond what specifically is known.  To illustrate, when we say that there are facts about (or within) the universe that we do not yet know, we are using 'fact' in the metaphysical sense, as in the epistemic sense a fact is always something known. If it is understood why the statement, 'Not all facts are facts', is not necessarily a contradiction, the relevant distinction is grasped.</p> <p> </p> <p>To refine this distinction, it may be said that being a fact in the metaphysical sense is a necessary condition of being a fact in the epistemic sense (as facts in the epistemic sense must be true, in some sense) but not a sufficient condition for being such (as truths are not necessarily known).  To illustrate this, consider the following predicate, where 'X' is a variable:</p> <p> </p> <p>[1] X is a fact in the epistemic sense.</p> <p> </p> <p>While [1] is true only when X is a fact in the metaphysical sense, not all facts in the metaphysical sense make [1] true.  A simple way to say this is to say that facts in the epistemic sense are the facts in the metaphysical sense that are known.</p> <p> </p> <p>The general question I pose for this meeting is: What are facts in the metaphysical sense?</p> <p> </p> <p>While it will be the point of the meeting to arrive at an answer to this question, I will draw a distinction that may aid thought on the matter.  Facts in the metaphysical sense must be either linguistic entities or non-linguistic entities (that covers about everything); that is, they must be either linguistic, or language-related, entities that represent reality in some manner, or states of reality in and of themselves that we may represent with language.  A rough way to illustrate this distinction is with the question: Do facts in the world make sentences true or false, or does the world make sentences into facts?</p> <p> </p> <p>Between now and the meet I will post links to any relevant readings that I find.  Members may post readings they find relevant in this meeting's comments section.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul M. Paolini</p> ",

"description": "<p>One way of characterizing philosophical theory--one that I think many traditional analytic philosophers would accept--is that it is much like scientific theory except that its data set (what it is based on and supported by) consists in intuitions (viewpoints that just seem right) rather than empirical observations. Just as scientific theorizing is constrained and tested by observations, philosophical theorizing is constrained and tested by intuitions in the relevant sense.  A possible difference between the two kinds of theorizing is that while empirical observations are generally more or less fixed constraints on scientific theory, the demands of overall coherence in philosophical theorizing may require rejecting some intuitions.  Generally, while science is more straightforwardly a matter of generating and explaining data, philosophy is concerned with developing coherent theoretical pictures, in various domains, that fit best, if not entirely, with relevant intuitions.   </p> <p> </p> <p>With regard to the above picture of philosophy, a much-discussed (supposed) new branch of philosophy, "experimental philosophy", believes it has something to add. While not necessarily rejecting traditional conceptions of philosophy, it believes that philosophizing can be improved by empirical inquiry into the psychological bases of the intuitions that philosophers rely upon. In "An Experimental Philosophy Manifesto", Joshua Knobe and Shaun Nichols explain that this empirical inquiry consists in surveys designed to elicit relevant intuitions from populations of non-philosophers. How these experimental results are seen to inform philosophical inquiry is explained as follows:</p> <p> </p> <p>"First we use the experimental results to develop a theory about the underlying psychological processes that generate people's intuitions; then we use our theory about the psychological processes to determine whether or not these intuitions are warranted." (Page 6)</p> <p> </p> <p>So, what experimental philosophy believes it adds to the picture of philosophy I gave above is an empirical test as to which intuitions in philosophy's data set are warranted.  In this way, they suppose, philosophy can go along as usual but on the basis of better, empirically-warranted intuitions. </p> <p> </p> <p>At this meeting, our question will be whether the idea of experimental philosophy, as explained by Knobe and Nichols, is sound.  A PDF of their very readable 12 page essay "An Experimental Philosophy Manifesto" is in the files section of this website.  Please read this essay at least once if you plan to attend.  For the more adventurous, I have put a PDF of a serious-minded critique of experimental philosophy in the files section as well.  This essay, optional for attendance, is by Antti Kauppinen and is called "The Rise and Fall of Experimental Philosophy".  For further/other reading, a Google search for "experimental philosophy" turns up many articles, varying in position and philosophical familiarity. While the Knobe and Nichols essay is the only required reading, the more brimming we are with thoughts about experimental philosophy the better. </p> <p> </p> <p>I conclude with a few points regarding my position on this matter. (I'm doing my own "experimental philosophy" regarding whether or not it's a good idea for me to take a position in the context of framing a topic.) I think a basic mistake of experimental philosophy is assuming that philosophically-relevant intuitions are psychological, e.g., outputs of psychological processes. While the sorts of intuitions experimental philosophers take as philosophically-relevant (such as what one would do in a trolley car case) may indeed be psychological, they are not the sorts of intuitions philosophers in fact rely upon.  The intuitions that philosophers do rely upon are the sort that stand or fall on the basis of coherence, not psychology-related warrant.  An illustration is the intuition that being an ethical person implies being an honest person.  We accept this not for psychological reasons, such as that we "associate" ethical people with honest people, but because it is hard for conceptual reasons to see how a person could be generally non-honest yet ethical. </p> <p> </p> <p>Experimental philosophy's mistake regarding the nature of philosophical intuitions leads to its mistake about the criterion of soundness of philosophical intuitions, and this in turn leads to a general obscuring of what philosophy is about.  Philosophy is about making conceptual sense of various domains of life--I think few would disagree with that--and the only thing that makes one instance of conceptual-sense-making better than another is coherence.  Philosophical intuitions are small simple solid points of coherence from which vast, glittering, interconnected webs of coherence may grow with philosophical tending. The idea that philosophy is grounded in psychology via psychological criteria of intuitional soundness misses the philosophical boat, which is made of light coherence, riveted with heavier coherence. </p> <p> </p> <p>I look forward to discussing all of this at the meeting.  Btw, if anyone wants to discuss the topic, share readings, or question or challenge my position, in the interim, our Facebook page (titled the same as our group) is the best place for this.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul M. Paolini</p> ",

"description": "<p>Metaphor, roughly speaking, consists in attributing a predicate to something, where it is known that the something does not literally have the predicate, for the purpose of saying something about the something that might be difficult or impossible to say in literal language. Examples of metaphors are 'my cat is a bachelor', 'the man is a tree', and 'she is the sun'.</p> <p> </p> <p>While metaphor might be associated with the literary arts, it is a general feature of ordinary language use--ordinary language is awash with metaphor--and some philosophers and theorists of language hold that it represents a basic aspect of how language works and develops.  To provide a sense of what some of these views are like--here I take monumental liberties with the ideas of Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure--think of language itself as a kind of fixed, shared, mental harp where the strings are literal word meanings.  When we speak, that is, play the harp, we are not limited to plucking one literal sting after another, but can pluck the harp with syntax in whatever way needed to produce our desired sound.  Metaphor, a more conventional unconventional technique, might be seen as plucking a string not for its base tone, but for its overtones. These overtones effected by the base tone of the string would be, on my view, implied meanings or connotations of the base word. So, musically, the audience would say, "He could not have meant us to take that tone literally, so he must intend us to focus on its overtones."  While my harp metaphor is quite limited, it does suggest the possible insight that metaphor is an act of speech that plays on a shared background of literal meaning. (But what is literal meaning and what makes it literal?)</p> <p> </p> <p>For this meeting, I propose that we center a general discussion of what metaphors are and how they work on a discussion of a classic short philosophical essay on metaphor, "What Metaphors Mean" (see files section for pdf), by the distinguished late philosopher and UC Berkeley professor, Donald Davidson (1917-2003). With regard to the essay, I suggest that those attending read it carefully and come to the meeting ready to discuss points of agreement or disagreement and inspired ideas.  Generally, I intend the meeting to be an opportunity to think deeply about metaphor and to become familiar (if one is not already) with a classic essay in the philosophy of language.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul M. Paolini</p> ",

"description": "<p>Reality no doubt contains subjects of awareness, that is, entities, such as us, that are conscious, and which have a variety of properties that presuppose consciousness, such as the properties of perception, propositional attitudes (beliefs, desires, and intents), and emotion.</p> <p>Our dominant theory of reality, however, holds that reality is essentially a distribution of lifeless matter, governed by the laws of physics, and that we are composed of nothing other than this matter.</p> <p>At least on the surface, then, it appears that reality is a distribution of matter that is somehow populated with subjects of awareness. This raises the question of whether reality in fact contains two basic substances--subjects of awareness and lifeless matter--or one basic substance from which one or both of these two distinct-seeming substances arise. (Note that 'substance' here means only 'category of being', and not necessarily 'material substance'.) The first alternative--that there are two basic substances--is known as substance dualism, and the second is known as substance monism.</p> <p>Generally speaking, the mind/body problem is the problem of understanding how subjects of awareness and lifeless matter--the two ostensible components of reality--are related.</p> <p>While accepting either substance dualism or substance monism is progress on the question, it is, either way, only the beginning of further questions that are possibly more challenging.</p> <p>Accepting substance dualism raises the question of the origin of subjects of awareness given that their origin is not lifeless matter. This question perhaps necessarily takes one into the realm of the supernatural and hence outside the scope of philosophy. Accepting substance monism, meanwhile, leads to main questions of contemporary philosophy.</p> <p>In accepting substance monism, new kinds of monism/dualism questions arise. For example, though holding that subjects of awareness are physical events of a sort, the question remains whether the sorts of properties peculiar to these events can be reduced to the sorts of properties that lifeless matter has as such. If one takes the answer to be no, one is a kind of <i>property dualist</i>.</p> <p>The idea for this meeting is to discuss our views on the mind body problem. Because the question of whether various sorts of monisms and dualisms clarify the relation between mind (subjects of awareness) and body (the distribution of matter) is at the center of the matter, I take the SEP entry on dualism, which is about dualism in the philosophy of mind, as the main reading for the meeting: <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dualism/</a> . Broader reading is of course encouraged.</p> <p>I look forward to the discussion.</p> <p>Cheers,<br/>Paul M. Paolini</p> ",

"description": "<p>The topic of discussion for this seminar-type meet will be Willard Van Orman Quine's 1951 essay, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism".  This essay, one of the most influential of 20th century analytic philosophy, does not oppose empiricism, but argues, rather, that certain assumptions of empiricism should be overturned.  Here is the essay's opening paragraph:</p> <p>Modern empiricism has been conditioned in large part by two dogmas. One is a belief in some fundamental cleavage between truths which are <i>analytic</i>, or grounded in meanings independently of matters of fact and truths which are <i>synthetic</i>, or grounded in fact. The other dogma is <i>reductionism</i>: the belief that each meaningful statement is equivalent to some logical construct upon terms which refer to immediate experience. Both dogmas, I shall argue, are ill founded. One effect of abandoning them is, as we shall see, a blurring of the supposed boundary between speculative metaphysics and natural science. Another effect is a shift toward pragmatism.</p> <p>At the meet, I will give a short talk explaining the arguments of the essay, then a discussion of our thoughts on the essay will be opened. As I think will be seen, the topics of the essay are still quite timely.  Here's a link to the essay:</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html"><a href="http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html" class="linkified">http://www.ditext.com/quine/quine.html</a></a></p> <p> </p> <p>There are parts of the essay that one would have to be a Quine scholar to understand fully, so do not be discouraged if some parts seem hopelessly opaque.</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul M.

"description": "<p><i>The safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.</i></p> <p>-Alfred North Whitehead</p> <p>The general topic for this meet, prepared jointly by member Gabe Paulson and me, will be the thought of Plato. Plato was a philosopher writing in the time and place of Classical Greece who addressed philosophical questions through the literary form of the dialogue. The lead protagonist in these dialogues, which number over thirty, was Plato's mentor, Socrates, who himself never wrote. Notoriously, there are very few important philosophical questions that Plato did not at least touch upon in his wide-ranging dialogues. The reason for this may be less Plato's prodigiousness than his influence on the very framework within which we ask philosophical questions in the west. If western philosophy has been but an elaboration of Plato ("a series of footnotes") then it should not be surprising if Plato's thought seems strangely germane and comprehensive even millennia later.</p> <p>The format of the meet will be as follows: Gabe and I will give talks with periods for discussion interspersed and following. Gabe's talk will provide an overview of Plato's thought according the following outline:</p> <p>1) Plato and his times<br/>   a) Pre-Socratics: Pythagoras, Parmenides.<br/>   b) Peloponnesian War: Greece’s Vietnam<br/>   c) Tragedians: Plato’s literary ambitions and style<br/>2) Plato’s Writings<br/>   a) His Early, Middle, Late Period<br/>   b) The parts and whole of his canon<br/>3) Intro to <i>The Republic</i><br/>   a) Book I summary<br/>   b) Quick summary of Books II-X</p> <p>My talk will focus on the discussion of <i>justice</i> in Book I of <i>The Republic</i>. I will summarize relevant arguments and frame questions for discussion.</p> <p>Reading for this meet: (optional for attendance but encouraged)<br/>Gabe's part:<br/>1) A 10 minute summary of Plato's works with some useful links: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato#Works" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato#Works</a><br/>2) A 10 minute summary of pre-Socratics with a helpful chart: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Socratic_philosophy</a><br/>3) Detailed outline of the Republic: <a href="http://www.ipfw.edu/pols/assets/syllabi/bartky/Y105/Y105PLATO.htm" class="linkified">http://www.ipfw.edu/pols/assets/syllabi/bartky/Y105/Y105PLATO.htm</a></p> <p>My part: Book I of <i>The Republic</i> (PDF in the Files section)</p> <p>This should be an especially fun meet as Plato is a delight to discuss.

"description": "<p>John Rawls (1921-2002) was a political philosophy professor at Harvard whose works have joined the rarified succession of great political thought; his treatise,  <i>A Theory of Justice</i> (1971), is the most frequently cited work in political philosophy next to John Locke's <i>Second Treatise on Government</i> (1690), and as his Harvard colleague Robert Nozick famously said, "political philosophers now must either work within Rawls' theory or explain why not."</p> <p> </p> <p>At this meet we will be treated to a talk concerning Rawls' <i>A Theory Justice</i> by member Martin Carcieri, who is a professor of political theory at San Francisco State University.

Time allowing, discussion will turn to a variety of contemporary social issues to which Rawls' theory has been applied.</p> <p> </p> <p>The reading for the meet is in the files section of our website.

"description": "<p>Power, in its sociological sense (as opposed to, e.g., its electrical sense), is a concept that plays very actively in public discussion and perhaps in our thought generally.  Usually, we can make judgments about power without giving it much thought: Obama is clearly more powerful than the average person, as are Bill Gates and Julia Roberts. But what does this mean? There are several kinds of philosophical thought experiments that are useful in opening up a question like this. One is to suppose you have been placed in charge of explaining the human phenomenon of power to a (benevolent) alien who lacks the concept.  How would you explain it? Another kind of experiment is to suppose you are confronted with someone who (for whatever reason) maintains that, say, Obama is not more powerful than the average person.  What argument would you put forth to show that this person is wrong? (If you would.) </p> <p> </p> <p>Once we have a sense of what power is, further interesting questions may remain, such as that of what kinds of power there are.  Do Obama, Gates, and Roberts, have different kinds of power, or is power a single thing that may vary in details?  Another question is: when is power just, or ethically sound, as opposed to unjust, or ethically wrong?  Certainly there are cases in which we would say that power is unjustly held.  While this may seem to have an easy explanation in the case of politics, where, e.g., a corrupt election can be referred to,  how would this extend to non- or less-political examples of possibly unjust power, such as in the case of the late bin Laden, or possible critiques of someone like Gates?  Is a general criterion of just power possible?</p> <p> </p> <p>Turning to our meet, miraculously, Wikipedia contains a rather fine entry on power from a philosophical perspective: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_%28philosophy%29" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_%28philosophy%29</a> .  Preparation for the meet will be to read this entry and to come to the meet ready to discuss the following questions:</p> <p>[1] What is power?</p> <p>[2] What kinds of power are there?</p> <p>[3] When is power just/unjust?</p> <p> </p> <p>It should be a good discussion.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul M.

"description": "<p>Our next two meets will be on ethical matters, so if you've been thinking about taking some time to clarify your views on ethics, this is an opportune moment.  The meet after next (10/9) will be on practical ethical issues relating to the work of philosopher Peter Singer, and will be co-organized by member Ian Lague.  The coming meet (9/25) will be on the prospects of ethics on the supposition that there is no such thing as objective moral truth. </p> <p> </p> <p>Moral anti-realism (the denial of moral realism) is the view that there are no objective moral truths.  If belief in objective moral truth is taken to mean belief that moral propositions--attributions of moral right and wrong--are true or false regardless of what we think or how we feel on moral matters, then one form of moral anti-realism would be the view that moral truth <i>is</i> a matter of what we think and how feel on moral matters.  This view is called <i>ethical subjectivism</i>, for the reason that it grounds morality in the attitudes of individuals, as opposed to a realm of mind-independent truth.  Another form, more radical, is the view that there is no moral truth at all, and that morality is simply a matter of how we feel. This is called <i>emotivism</i>, for the reason that it grounds morality in emotional responses of individuals. </p> <p> </p> <p>The questions for this meet are: If there were no objective moral truth, would there be any point to arguing about moral matters? Would it mean that arguing about morality is like arguing about whether ice cream is delicious?  Or is there a way in which moral argument, despite an absence of objective truth, is meaningful?  If so how?</p> <p> </p> <p>The links below provide a wealth of thought on these matters; and so perhaps I should say not to feel overwhelmed by it; as usual, our discussion on the issue will be pitched at the level that it matters to us.   The links include SEP or Wikipedia entries on moral anti-realism, ethical subjectivism, and emotivism.  Feel obliged to read these only as far as they provide inspiration for the meet.  I also include a link to an SEP entry about philosopher C. L. Stevenson, who early in his career was denied tenure at Yale due to his anti-realist, emotivist views on ethics. This entry is mainly about Stevenson's inquiry into how (anti-realist) moral disagreement works.    </p> <p> </p> <p>Moral Anti-Realism: <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/</a></p> <p>C.

"description": "<p>[<i>This meetup was conceived by member Ian Lague. Ian wrote the topic text below and will be the main moderator at the meet. Many thanks to Ian</i>.]</p> <p>This meetup will focus on Australian philosopher Peter Singer's views about beneficence and moral obligation. The force of Singer's argument here can be conveyed through a thought experiment he introduced in his 1972 article, "Famine, Affluence, and Morality":</p> <p><i>Imagine that you are out taking a walk and see a child drowning in a shallow pond. You happen to be wearing a $200 pair of shoes and you know they will be ruined if you wade into the pond. Under the circumstances, do you wade in, ruin your shoes, and save the child?</i></p> <p>Now, for many people, the morality of this situation seems trivially obvious. We say without hesitation that we would intervene to save the child's life, even if that means sacrificing our expensive shoes. Allowing the child's death to preserve a luxury item seems like a grave moral failure. Under the circumstances, we might even say we have a duty to sacrifice the item in order to save the child's life.</p> <p>Here, however, the philosopher springs a trap on us. For Singer claims that nearly all of us find ourselves, every day, in a situation morally equivalent to the one described above. Due to global communications and aid distribution networks, each of us has the power to intervene decisively, to protect individuals threatened by famine, disease, war, and disaster—who are, in effect, dying before our eyes. Instead, we spend our extra money on fashionable clothes, gourmet meals, iphones, sporting goods, philosophy books, etc. How can we justify this conduct?</p> <p>A side note: To stay focused on philosophy, I'd like to suggest that we avoid <i>empirical</i> debates about the effectiveness of aid, whether it aggravates famines, fails to reach intended recipients, undermines population-control efforts, etc.. (Singer and the NYU philosopher Peter Unger do address these concerns in their work. Unger makes a detailed and powerful case in <i>Living High and Letting Die</i> [1996] that a $200 donation to Oxfam or UNICEF is sufficient in most cases to ensure that a sickly 2-year-old in the developing world survives long enough to become a healthy 6-year-old.) I'd also like to suggest that we avoid broader metaethical questions this time, such as whether one can speak of any moral obligation beyond the whims of culture or individual minds. (I do vote for meeting devoted to Relativism soon, however, and have some classic pro/con articles in mind.)</p> <p>Instead, I suggest we discuss our intuitions about the drowning-child scenario and what philosophical principles might stand behind them. Singer claims to identify one such principle, which other philosophers have termed "the greater moral evil rule." It states: <b>If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it.</b></p> <p>This principle, if accepted, has radical implications for the way we live in modern consumer societies. For one thing, it transforms many charitable acts typically viewed as <i>supererogatory</i>--good deeds not required by morality--into the mere fulfillment of <i>moral duties</i>. Not surprisingly, this principle has been criticized on many fronts. Some of the most interesting involve the claim that our common notions of <i>rights</i> and <i>desert</i> blunt the force of the greater moral evil rule. (For a good example, see John Arthur's "World Hunger and Moral Obligation: The Case against Singer" in the "Files" section.)</p> <p>I find Singer's arguments on this subject difficult to dismiss, but I don't have a settled position about it. So I'm definitely looking forward to hearing the group's thoughts on all these questions. -Ian</p> <p>You can find Singer's general-interest elaborations of his argument here:<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/6dkfjjb" class="linkified">http://tinyurl.com/6dkfjjb</a><br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/62dfk5a" class="linkified">http://tinyurl.com/62dfk5a</a><br/><a href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/idea" class="linkified">http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/idea</a><br/>(This last site represents Singer's effort to let people take action if they accept his view. It is based on a weaker version of the greater moral evil rule, and has people pledging 1 to 5% of their income to selected aid groups.)</p> <p>You can find Singer's original article here, from <i>Philosophy and Public Affairs</i>:<br/><a href="http://tinyurl.com/6cfombd" class="linkified">http://tinyurl.com/6cfombd</a></p> <p>And some good summaries of the debate here:<br/><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/international-justice/" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/international-justice/</a> (See section 2.1 Famine and Development)<br/><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principle-beneficence/" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/principle-beneficence/</a> (See section 4.

"description": "<p>"It is not how things are in the world that is mystical, but <i>that</i> it exists."<br/>-Wittgenstein, Tractatus 6.44</p> <p> </p> <p>For this meet I propose a discussion of why the universe exists and of the question, "Why does the universe exist?"  Below I hope to show that this proposal is not as silly as it may seem.  A philosopher may learn a lot about the general problem of knowing the world by trying to take the relevant question seriously.  </p> <p>Why does the universe exist?--or better, why is there <i>something</i> rather than <i>nothing</i>? A reasonable response to this question is that it is silly because it cannot be answered.  But if it cannot be answered why is this?  Is it because the question has an answer but one we cannot know, or is it because it has no answer to know?</p> <p>Let us suppose that we believe that the question has an answer but that we cannot know it.  What would this mean? With more ordinary questions, it is clear that questions sometimes have answers that cannot be known. For example, the question of how much Plato weighed on his 30th birthday has an answer though we cannot know it (assuming it wasn't recorded).  How this is possible can be explained by noting that there being a fact of the matter with respect to a question is usually independent of whether we can know that fact, as usually we do not bring facts into existence by knowing them; they are there whether we know them or not. Plato had a weight on his 30th birthday whether we can know it or not.  </p> <p>It is questionable, however, whether the question of why the universe exists is relevantly similar to the case of ordinary questions.  With ordinary questions that have unknowable answers we can usually say that the unknowable answers could be formulated in our language.  Is this true with respect to the question of why the universe exists?  If so, what is our barrier to knowing the answer--given that there is no basic conceptual limitation, as this suggests?  If not, what does it mean for a question to have an answer that cannot be formulated in our language?  Can we say there is a fact of the matter with respect to why the universe exists if our language is not rich enough to demarcate such a fact?  Does it make sense to speak of facts that we cannot even in principle define?  If so, what makes an undefinable fact a fact?</p> <p>Now let us suppose that we believe the relevant question has no answer to be known. One reason we might give for this relates to the final questions in the previous paragraph: it makes no sense to speak of there being a fact of the matter with respect to the question; hence there is no answer to be known.  Another reason we might give is that the word 'why' in the question falsely implies that there was a purpose for which the universe was created; the universe was not <i>created</i> let alone created for a purpose; hence the question has no answer.</p> <p>The second reason above--the denial that the universe was created for a purpose--is a more common reason for dismissing the question of why the universe exists as silly.   This is arbitrary, however, in my view, because "why" is just as easily and soundly interpreted in the more secular causal sense of "why".  </p> <p>As a final question, with respect to the causal sense of "why", what are we missing, if anything, to give a causal explanation of why the universe exists?</p> <p>With the above I hope I've raised questions that will inspire a fun and interesting meet. I haven't yet identified relevant readings, but when and if I do I will post them.  As usual, looking forward to the discussion.</p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> ",

"description": "<p>For this meet our concern will be with <i>moral relativism</i>--with what 'moral relativism' means and whether moral relativism is a sounder position than its opposing position, <i>moral absolutism</i>. Below, I discuss the topic briefly, then co-organizer Ian Lague discusses the readings for the meet.</p> <p>The debate between moral relativism and moral absolutism might be interpreted, due to the unfortunate term 'absolutism', as a debate between those who acknowledge and tolerate a diversity of valid moral viewpoints (the relativists) and those who believe themselves to be in possession of the sole moral truth and who are intolerant of those with moral views that differ from theirs (the absolutists). This interpretation, however, is based on a few arbitrary assumptions. First, the claim that morality is absolute does not imply a claim to know what the absolute moral truth is; that is, one can claim that morality is absolute without claiming to know anything about what is morally right or wrong.  Second, even when a moral absolutist believes he or she knows the absolute moral truth, there is no necessity that he or she will be intolerant of other views on same.</p> <p>So what is the essence of the debate between moral relativism and moral absolutism? This itself is a substantive philosophical question. A tentative way of understanding it is as follows: let A, B and C, be three <i>contradictory</i> moral worldviews (comprehensive moral  viewpoints) belonging respectively to three distinct individuals, groups or cultures. The moral relativist says that despite the inconsistency among A, B and C, all three can be entirely true, or valid. In contrast, the moral absolutist says that at the points at which any two of A, B and C conflict, the two cannot both be right.</p> <p>The essence of the debate, then, seems to be whether a <i>single</i> situation or event can be morally acceptable from one moral perspective while morally wrong from another. But to this a moral relativist might say that it makes no sense to speak of a <i>single</i> situation or event being viewed from two different perspectives because situations and events are <i>defined</i> by the perspective from which they are viewed. To illustrate, when an American sees parents from a different culture arranging a marriage for their daughter, the situation understood by the American is not the same situation as that understood by the parents, unless the American happens to be fully fluent in the other culture. The American, then, in judging the situation morally, is really only judging his or her own <i>imposed</i> understanding of the situation; thus, what it means for morality to be relative is that moral judgment is always a matter of perspective, and there is no absolute perspective.</p> <p>To this, the moral absolutist might say that if members of two different moral worldviews cannot talk about the <i>same</i> situations and events, then distinct moral worldviews <i>cannot be in conflict</i>; moral conflict requires different judgments about the <i>same</i> situations and events. Given this, it is not clear what claim differentiates moral relativism from moral absolutism. For if different moral worldviews are not in conflict, but only <i>incommensurate</i>--i.e., different and not inter-translatable--then why couldn't different moral worldviews be merely different interpretations of the same domain of moral truth? That is, it seems that what the moral relativist claims is not incompatible with moral absolutism.</p> <p>So moral relativism does seem to depend on the possibility of there being two equally valid moral viewpoints that stand in contradiction--or a single situation or event that is morally acceptable from one perspective while morally wrong from another. Is this an actual possibility? The readings, now to be discussed by Ian, provide, among other things, various answers to this question. -Paul</p> <p>[The readings can be found in the "files" section of this site, under "more" in the nav bar toward the top of the page.]</p> <p>“A Defense of Moral Relativism,” Ruth Benedict<br/>This is a classic argument in favor of cultural moral relativism, a position that developed most seriously in anthropology departments. (So much so that the American Anthropology Association refused to participate in UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1947.)For Benedict, the diversity of moral perspectives in different cultures leads to a simple conclusion: “It is morally good” means “It is habitual.” No other talk of moral values is meaningful.</p> <p>“Trying Out One’s New Sword,” Mary Midgley<br/>Another classic argument, this one against a popular type of cultural moral relativism Midgley calls “moral isolationism.” This is the position that no one can understand any culture except her own well enough to judge it. Midgley argues that really holding such a position would constitute a ban on all moral reasoning, including that within our own culture—because it would make comparisons impossible. But Midgley points out that most moral isolationists advocate their position in the name of “tolerance” or “respect” for other cultures, or try to explain the plausibility of controversial practices “in context.” These normative claims are themselves moral judgments across cultures, which in Midgley’s view is inescapable.</p> <p>“An Alternative to Moral Relativism,” Lawrence Adam Lengbeyer<br/>An argument in favor of cultural moral pluralism, the view that there can be “multiple correct answers to ethical questions of right and wrong, good and bad, better and worse.”</p> <p>“Who’s To Judge?” Louis Pojman</p> <p>The most systematic critique of relativism on offer here, and probably the best one to read, since it encompasses several of the other arguments. </p> <p>Pojman distinguishes the “diversity thesis” (<i>moral variation among cultures implies no moral universals</i>) from the “dependency thesis” (<i>moral principles derive their validity from their cultural acceptance</i>). Together these premises are supposed to entail ethical relativism (<i>there are no universally valid moral principles</i>).</p> <p>To narrow his target, Pojman first considers and rejects a “weak” dependency thesis—one that leaves room for shared moral principles, since it is merely a matter of different <i>applications</i> (or different factual premises) that account for the moral differences between cultures. But this does not entail ethical relativism, since there could still be overlapping principles, at a sufficient level of generality. (Paul makes a related point above, concluding that much of what passes for relativism may simply involve these differences of perspective.)</p> <p>Pojman also dismisses <i>subjective</i> or individual ethical relativism: because most people who hold such a position nevertheless demand justice from someone in some situations, and because it seems to nullify ethics by reducing it to a matter of personal aesthetic taste—for saintliness or mass murder or anything else. (For more on individual ethical relativism, see the Nagel essay below.)</p> <p>This leaves Pojman to argue against “conventional” or cultural moral relativism. First, he says it warrants scrutiny because of its consequences. Cultural relativism has no answer to ethnocentrism—since it can’t without contradiction lay claim to any intercultural values, such as tolerance. Nor can it endorse any reform or change in a culture, no matter how oppressive or even genocidal that culture may be—since broad cultural acceptance is the only available standard of moral legitimacy. And what could “cultural acceptance” of a specific action mean, given the blurry borders of cultures and the multiple cultural affinities of any given person?</p> <p>With regard to the original argument, Pojman contends that there is no logical connection between moral diversity among cultures (<i>how things are</i>) and what moral principles <i>should</i> guide cultures (<i>how things ought to be).</i> He also argues that there is no reason to support a “strong dependency thesis”: that a current cultural consensus is the only available standard of morality. Instead, reformers make arguments and offer thought experiments to demonstrate the immorality of such practices as slavery, widow-burning, and colonialism. The fact that we may not be able to <i>know</i> with certainty that these reforms are right does reduce these moral arguments to mere ethnocentric appeals.</p> <p>“The Objective Basis of Morality,” Thomas Nagel</p> <p>[Summary TK]</p> ",

"description": "<p>'Scientism' is a word generally used as a term of criticism for thinkers who seem to take science-related thinking too far.  For example, a theist might charge a philosopher with scientism if the latter claimed that the scientific worldview is the only worldview that can be taken seriously by an intelligent person; further, a philosopher might charge a scientist with scientism if the latter claimed that science has made philosophy obsolete.  It should be emphasized here that 'scientism' is not an <i>anti-science</i> term–not any more than 'pseudo-science' is–but only a term concerning taking science-related thinking <i>too far</i>.   </p> <p> </p> <p>My approach in framing the discussion for this meet shall consist in discussing two kinds of conversation we might have about scientism and leaving it somewhat open as to what in particular we discuss at the meet.  As a supposed social phenomenon, scientism may be the subject of a variety of perspectives and experiences that would be interesting to discuss at the meet; so my approach shall be to point members toward a variety of readings and let the meet be generally about what we made of the reading and our thought generally.</p> <p> </p> <p>One kind of discussion we might have concerns the meaning of the word 'scientism'.  What exactly is scientism supposed to be? What's the error within it? Our first reading, the Wikipedia entry on 'scientism', gives a fairly standard, though quite interesting, account:</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism</a></p> <p> </p> <p>I find this account, and those like it, a bit puzzling, however. The reason is that though 'scientism' is used as a term of &lt;em style="font-size : small"&gt;criticism</i>, standard accounts tend to try to define it as a &lt;em style="font-size : small"&gt;descriptive</i> term, i.e., with definitions of the form: scientism &lt;em style="font-size : small"&gt;is the view that</i> . . . .  If scientism is a term of criticism then it cannot have purely descriptive content; and if it is purely a term of description then it cannot have critical content.  What is going on here? In the following essay, our second reading, published on Prof. Massimo Pigliucci's <i>Rationally Speaking</i> blog, I try to sort this out:</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/12/scientism-as-scientistic-belief.html" class="linkified">http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/12/scientism-as-scientistic-belief.html</a></p> <p>In the essay, I argue that scientism must be a matter of flawed reasoning about the significance of science rather than extremeness in philosophical positions about science.</p> <p> </p> <p>The other kind of discussion we might have concerns our thoughts on potential examples of scientism, such as this rather over-the-top essay, our third reading, by Timothy Ferris:</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/10/intellectual-vs-engineer/all/1" class="linkified">http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2011/10/intellectual-vs-engineer/all/1</a></p> <p> </p> <p>and on actual scientism-related criticism, such as that in the following essay, our fourth and final official reading, by writer Marilynne Robinson (thanks to Ian for this selection):</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://solutions.synearth.net/2006/10/20/" class="linkified">http://solutions.synearth.net/2006/10/20/</a></p> <p> </p> <p>In this essay, Robinson takes a critical look at Richard Dawkins' book <i>The God Delusion</i>.  </p> <p> </p> <p>Beyond the above reading, the web is awash with articles concerning scientism. Read widely and come to the meet ready to discuss your perspectives/experiences concerning scientism.</p> <p>As always, I look forward to the conversation.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> ",

"description": "<p>The political philosophy of marriage is concerned with how marriage is treated by the state. More specifically, it is concerned with the question of what the law of marriage should be, given that there should be a law of marriage.  As same-sex marriage has been a major part of the national conversation in recent years, with various states either officially banning or instituting same-sex marriage, this topic should be quite familiar to most. I should say, however, that same-sex mariage is only one of a number of major issues in the political philosophy of marriage.</p> <p> </p> <p>Before discussing various questions for the meet, I'll mention that the following discussion does a great job in clarifying various aspects of the topic:</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://vimeo.com/31510618" class="embedded">http://vimeo.com/31510618</a></p> <p> </p> <p>It's a conversation between two political philosophy professors, Elizabeth Brake and Simon May, whose work more or less directly relates to marriage.</p> <p> </p> <p>A basic question in the political philosophy of marriage is that of what justifies legal recognition of marriage at all.  What business has the state in keeping track of certain amorous relationships among adults in the first place? A reasonable answer to this is that such relationships have strong legal significance relating to property, death without a will, custody of children, and so on.  The question remains, however, why legal provisions that accomodate these issues should be conceived in a way that coincides so closely with a certain amorous relationship between one man and one woman.  Should it continue in this narrow way?</p> <p> </p> <p>This of course is one of the questions that divide people on the same-sex marriage debate.  There seems to be three main positions on this: one position is that marriage should be left as it traditionally has been because changing the meaning of 'marriage' by including same-sex couples would compromise a valued tradition;  a second position is that marriage should be extended to other consenting adults who wish to marry as it is a violation of equality not to; a third position is that the interpretation of "marriage" should be left to the private sphere and that law should focus on provisions that have less to do with the traditional notion of marriage and more to do with practical legal issues.  </p> <p> </p> <p>The second and third positions above are positions that might be justified on the basis of the political philosophy of John Rawls.  The relevant general idea of Rawlsian liberalism is that state policies should be justified not on the basis of particular comprehensive moral or religious views but on values that all such comprehensive views would reasonably affirm, such as equality.  For a Rawlsian, then, the question becomes: on what basis could same-sex couples be excluded from marriage? If there is no justifying value that transcends particular comprehensive views, then excluding same-sex couples from marriage is forbidden on the basis of equality.  Here I should mention that Professor Martin "Marty" Carcieri, a political theorist at S.F. State, informed me that he plans to attend the meet and will be willing to explain Rawls' general philosophy to us in greater detail, as well as inform us about the prospects of Proposition 8--the 2008 California ballot proposition that seeks to ban same-sex marriage in California via constitutional amendment--which has been working its way through appeals.  </p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_8" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proposition_8</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Beyond the more familiar same-sex marriage issue, there's the question of group marriage.  Should groups of three or more consenting adults be legally allowed to marry, or something similar?  How does your answer to this question fit with your views on earlier questions? </p> <p> </p> <p>Generally, our conversation at the meet will be on what consistent and ethical view can unify the diverse issues regarding the state's treatment of marriage.  In preparing for this, another reading that might be interesting to peruse is the Wikipedia entry on marriage:</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage</a></p> <p> </p> <p>As usual, I look forward to the conversation.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> ",

"description": "<p>For this meet let's have a focused discussion on the nature of ideology and how ideology exists in today's world.  </p> <p> </p> <p>For some time, I've thought of ideology such that one's ideology is the way one's beliefs and values add up to a unitary normative picture of the world; that is, one's ideology is a picture of how the world ought to be that has as its building blocks conscious beliefs and values.  Recently, however, I became aware of another conception of ideology (via Zizek), one in which ideology is something that generally exists outside of one's conscious awareness and which gives one one's sense of how the world "just is."  For example, when we see only two possible alternatives on a moral or political issue, when in fact there are more than two, it may be ideology that limits our view.  While I find this alternative view intriguing, I couldn't say what's at stake in the question of  accepting it over my previous view.  Sorting out such things is part of my motive in framing this meet.</p> <p> </p> <p>To prepare for the meet, read the following Wikipedia article on ideology, as well as anything else you like that is relevant, and compose a list of questions you would like to discuss further with the group:</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideology</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Ideally, your questions will relate to your own challenges in forming a coherent view regarding how we ought to think about the notion of ideology.  </p> <p> </p> <p>An additional (optional) resource for the meet is the following talk by philosopher Slavoj Zizek on ideology in the contemporary world:</p> <p> </p> <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdzMCUaJQ6g&amp;feature=bf_next&amp;list=PL8FAB2EEFFAF6253E&amp;lf=results_main" class="embedded">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdzMCUaJQ6g&amp;feature=bf_next&amp;list=PL8FAB2EEFFAF6253E&amp;lf=results_main</a></p> <p> </p> <p>As usual, I look forward to the discussion.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul</p> ",

"description": "<p>(Thanks to member Caroline for inspiring this topic.)</p> <p>We might be inclined to say that a person who is honest, trustworthy, hard-working, and compassionate, <i>has a good character</i>, and that a person who is dishonest, untrustworthy, lazy, and callous, <i>has a bad character</i>. But does it really make sense to talk about an inherent difference--called "character"--between these two people? If humans come into the world nearly identical psychologically, and remain so--and there may be scientific reasons to believe this--shouldn't we say that the difference between these two people is due to their different situations and life histories, and not to any inherent differences that might be called "character"? This is roughly what philosopher Gilbert Harman argues, with the aid of social psychological research, in his essay "Moral Philosophy Meets Social Psychology":</p> <p><a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~harman/Papers/Virtue.html" class="linkified">http://www.princeton.edu/~harman/Papers/Virtue.html</a></p> <p> </p> <p>At this meet we will discuss the concept of character using Harman's essay as a main reference point.

"description": "<p><i>Ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country</i></p> <p>- John F. Kennedy</p> <p> </p> <p>The word 'patriotism' may be as old-fashioned as knickerbockers and powdered wigs, but the issue it represents--in meaning something along the lines of national commitment--has arguably never been more timely.  The growing internationalization of business, among other things, has complicated the ethical relation between individuals/private organizations and nations, and as a result relevant obligations are as unclear as ever.</p> <p> </p> <p>As an illustration, in one of his talks, Robert Reich, a professor of public policy at UC Berkeley, mentions asking Silicon Valley executives about the crisis in California public education.  Their response was that they can find talent worldwide; i.e., they did not regard it as a concern of theirs. Is this attitude reasonable or is there something ethically dubious about it?</p> <p> </p> <p>Our discussion at the meet will be on the nature of patriotism and whether the notion should still have any hold on us in today's world.

"description": "<p>For this meet I propose a balanced discussion of  economic equality, and notions of social equality generally--a heated topic these days. By "a balanced discussion" I mean that our aim, being philosophers, shall be to look charitably at the fullest range of possible positions on the matter that we can, and to avoid becoming a meeting of either Occupy Wall Street or the Ayn Rand Society.</p> <p> </p> <p>According to the statistics going around, the bottom 50% of the US owns around 1% of the nation's wealth while the top 1% owns over 20%, with the top 10% owning over 70%.</p> <p> </p> <p>Some find this wealth distribution unproblematic--a sign of economic health even. This sort of distribution is the natural result of a society that is willing to reward leadership and innovation.  There are a lot of poor people, but: 1) society cannot be conceived as a competition that brings out and rewards the best without accepting that there will be a large population of "the lesser off," and 2) it is arguable, if not demonstrable, that the system that has led to the above wealth distribution is one that makes the lesser off better off--due to the values produced by well-rewarded leadership and innovation--than any other system; it's better to ride the coattails of the rich into the starry heavens than it is to be stuck in the mud of a communist bog.</p> <p> </p> <p>Others might generally agree with the above but believe that wealth inequality has become too extreme. Our capitalist system is generally the right way to go; we just need a cure of excesses--e.g., to get executive compensation under control via greater empowerment of shareholders--and adjustments in government policy--e.g., adjustments in tax rates.</p> <p> </p> <p>Still others might hold that capitalism itself is the problem, and that radical wealth inequality is just one of its evil consequences, along with the destruction of the planet, and the production of a culture that requires people who are not actually stupid to cultivate a sort of learned stupidity in order to participate--or else face alienation.  Leadership and innovation?  Leadership and innovation for what? So that we can watch more channels of cable television on our mobile phones? So that movies can go further in the direction of high-tech cartoons for adults? So that McDonald's can truck its frozen hamburger patties a greater distance? The capitalist "competition" conception of human society is merely a fairy tale that the exploiting class uses to delude itself and con the poor--and one that is turning the world into a nightmare. What we need to do instead of moving forward with capitalism is to think deeply about our human needs and wants and develop an intelligent cooperative system to meet them.</p> <p> </p> <p>So sayeth those people, and of course there are other positions.  To me it seems a basic question in these differing views on economic inequality is that of whether society should be conceived as a competition or a cooperative.  While I like the idea of a cooperative society in which everyone gets what they need and has the opportunity to get what they want, I think it is questionable whether this is realistic given human nature. Perhaps society must be a competition, with grave consequences for losing, if it is to bring out the best in people. Or perhaps not.</p> <p>What do you think on these matters? We'll be interested to hear at the meet.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers,</p> <p>Paul</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> ",

"description": "<p>Inspired by the Bay Area's tradition of parallel fireworks displays over the bay on the 4th of July, our group and the Berkeley Philosophy Reading Group, organized by Peter M., will be holding parallel meets in the last half of August on the topic: Is patriotism a virtue? Peter was inspired to frame this new topic by the meet on patriotism our group had a few meets ago, and we thought it might be interesting to experiment with providing two opportunities to discuss the same topic. The Berkeley group's meet will be Thursday, August 23rd in the evening; please see their website for details: <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Berkeley-philosophy/" class="linkified">http://www.meetup.com/Berkeley-philosophy/</a></p> <p> </p> <p>The question of whether patriotism is a virtue naturally touches on both the nature of patriotism and that of virtue, so those are both things to be thinking about.</p> <p> </p> <p>The reading list, finely composed and annotated by Peter, is below. The Berkeley group, being a reading group, requires attendees to do all the reading. For our group, being less of a reading group, only the MacIntyre essay (in bold) is required, though reading as much as possible is highly encouraged.</p> <p> </p> <p>I look forward to the conversations.

"description": "<p> </p> <p>Hello Folks! Apologies for the delay in posting a meet, which was induced chiefly by difficulty finding a location that was both spacious enough to accommodate our group and accessible by BART. I finally found one, in the very shadow of the 24th Street and Mission BART station, and talked to the owners of the said locale, the Silverstone Cafe, who would be happy to have us. Our meetings will be held in the courtyard in the back, weather permitting, or inside else-wise.</p> <p>The key to finding a location was looking at the environs of several BART stations. Likewise, the key to empirical investigation is doubtless looking at several hypotheses that are available in the sense that they seem reasonable and are testable. But can we say anything in general about what makes them 'look reasonable', or give us the related information of which among reasonable hypotheses are most reasonable so as to decide which tests to conduct first? One of the very few guidelines that have been consistently proposed as universally applying to the choice of hypotheses is known as ontological simplicity, or Occam's Razor, which states in its original version that “entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity.” A more modern formulation might run that simple hypotheses are to be preferred to complex hypotheses, provided that we are willing to make a set of background or auxiliary assumptions that together with the simple hypotheses are capable of explaining what we observe. But what are the possible justifications of such a principle, and do these justifications lead us to believe that we should apply the Razor everywhere or instead tell us where to apply it?</p> <p>Clearly, we cannot declare that all hypotheses we happen to consider simple are more likely to be true than all hypotheses we happen to consider complicated. Even if ontological simplicity simply is more likely in nature than ontological complexity, simplicity in our language does not equate to simplicity <i>simplicitur</i>. The elements of everyday language are not the elements of the ultimate constitution of reality. For instance, in everyday language Aristotle's hypothesis that sublunar and supra-lunar objects simply are different may be parsimonious (apply Occam's razor). They would seem simply different to us too if we didn't already know Galilean-Newtonian science, which uses a language whose building blocks are different from those of the language prior to that science. In retrospect, that there be only one kind of object in the universe with respect to gravity seems like the essence of simplicity, but the very fact that it didn't occur to people for a very long time suggests that what we consider simple is not just a given but a function of how leading theories of our day teach us to think.</p> <p>What explanations we consider parsimonious with regards to a specific subject is of course also a function of our background information concerning that subject. When he learns that a certain county in early American New Jersey was Federalist, though surrounded by and economical similar to Democratic-Republican counties, a historian of the period actually ignores a number of extremely simple explanations that the evidence doesn't contradict explicitly but that don't fit the pattern he has learned generally governs early American politics. It is not likely, for instance, that the inhabitants of this particular county have an ideology favoring centralized government that overrules their economic concerns if that has been found to be the case nowhere else in New Jersey or the early Middle Atlantic US. It may be the verbally simplest hypothesis, but it may also simply be a waste of time to put forth the considerable effort to test the hypothesis against the record because background information makes it unlikely. This it does largely by requiring very low-probability events within the domain researched that would serve to make this county simply different. Like considerations forms the basis of a view of Occam's razor as applying only given a particular definition of simplicity formulated relative to background knowledge. An example of this family of views can be found in the Eliot Sober piece whose link I attach at the end of this mini-essay.</p> <p>Both of these qualifications of simplicity <i>simplicitur</i> suggest that ontological simplicity may not be the best principle to apply chronologically first in investigating a completely mysterious natural phenomenon, because having an idea what it really means in such an instance requires a lot of prior work. It may be a great principle to apply pedagogically, that is when reconstructing why a theory is true for novice students, but that does not make it the key, or the first key, to actually producing human knowledge for the first time. So one perhaps cynical answer to the question of when Occam's razor is a good principle to apply is 'when you are already sure that what seems simple really is simple'; or more precisely, when one has a good theoretical framework which there are reasons to be believe maps words unto things as they actually occur.</p> <p>However, there is a more direct criticism, rather than a qualification, of the razor that involves situations where we already <i>think</i> we have a theoretical framework. That theoretical framework may seem to parsimoniously make good prediction and invoke only entities we have good reason to believe are out there, but be simply <i>wrong</i> on account of other considerations we were unaware of. Much here turns on the imprecision of the term 'good prediction'; there may be good predictions, but new entities or principles of greater complexity may make yet better predictions. The deepest question concerning the razor is perhaps 'when is simplicity real, rather than just convenient?', which relates it to large and intractable metaphysical issues.</p> <p> </p> <p>At <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/"><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/simplicity/</a></a>,      a number of different kinds of general justifications of Occam's Razor and certain other issues and criticisms can be found.</p> <p>At <a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/05/razoring-ockhams-razor.html"><a href="http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/05/razoring-ockhams-razor.html" class="linkified">http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2011/05/razoring-ockhams-razor.html</a></a> may be found a summary of a Sober-like view.</p> <p> </p> <p>At <a href="http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/Let's%20Razor%20Ockham's%20Razor.pdf" class="linkified">http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/Let's%20Razor%20Ockham's%20Razor.pdf</a> is the Sober piece itself.</p> <p>I have also put my personal view of the Razor in the 'Files' section of this website.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>-Cheers,</p> <p>David</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> ",

"description": "<p> </p> <p><b>The Philosophy of Education</b></p> <p>Knowing How and Knowing that in the Classroom</p> <p> </p> <p>Greetings fellow philosophers. I would first like to extend my apology for the considerable gap between meetings, engendered by a combination of difficulties finding a suitable location after becoming aware of problems with the last location I found and various personal problems. I trust that the true philosophers have not stopped <i>thinking</i> about philosophy on their own and that the meet will be enriched by the extra time for reflection.</p> <p> </p> <p>The topic I propose this time is broadly the philosophy of education. If the discussion is fruitful, we may have occasion to discuss different aspects of the large topic in more detail on future occasions. I owe this suggestion to my good friend the eminent SF philosophy Meetup member Kenny Burgher.</p> <p> </p> <p>Since all areas of philosophy are concerned with the proper way of thinking, and education concerns itself with the best means of reproducing the best thinking in current and future generations, there is an important sense in which the philosophy of education is not just a branch of philosophy like the philosophies of mind or science, but an extension of all of them which asks how we are to decide which philosophies to teach to whom, when, and how to teach them best. After all, any change in the world through the understanding of philosophy has to be taught if it is not going to be confined to a few people. The philosophy of education is of direct relevance to the possible <i>praxis</i> of philosophy, and as such was of great interests to Plato, John Dewey and the pragmatists, and others who gave thought to applying philosophy to everyday living.</p> <p> </p> <p>This is too broad a subject to be fruitful in a short discussion. To narrow the focus while staying in keeping with the breadth of the subject in spirit, I propose basing our more precise question on the classical and common-sensical distinction between 'knowing how' and 'knowing that' articulated as such by Gilbert Ryle. Assuming that it is a real distinction in ways of knowing, of each it can be asked how it is best acquired, whether it can be taught and if so how, as well as what the interaction between them is. Quite manifestly, each of the ordinary subjects we learn in school involves both. The question is which should take precedence in the choice of examples and perspectives. While it is clear that you can't have one without the other, the question of priority is not, and neither is the question of how much time to devote to either. Therefore, I propose the precise question: 'given <i>some</i> unspecified subject matter involving both motor and verbal habits and an <i>abstract</i> body of theory justifying them, which should be taught first and why?' As some will no doubt notice, this formulation is closely based on Ryle's views of abstract knowledge of laws and principles as warrants to make certain kinds of assertions or do certain kinds of things.</p> <p> </p> <p>I don't see the adoption of some of Ryle's terminology as creating a bias hindering other points of view; it provides a specific starting point to anchor discussion with which others are allowed, and even encouraged, to vehemently disagree. As for the phrase 'some unspecified subject matter', though, it is there for a reason I firmly trust in. While it may seem easier to argue about subjects on a case-by-case basis, I think it most fruitful philosophically to attempt formulation of general principles without the crutch of subject matter knowledge and to <i>subsequently</i> see if they pass hold muster in light of the precise nature of given subject matters. At least it forces a general discussion, even if none of the initial results hold water in light of the subject matter. It also provides a framework for dealing with the related but non-identical question of whether learning is best done by doing. I welcome feedback if the question seems loaded to anyone, but don't believe it to be so.</p> <p> </p> <p>Cheers, and hope to see many of you Sunday the 5th. I will attach files related to the question shortly.</p> <p> </p> ",

"description": "<p>Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Slap! An experience all too familiar to many of us. And for many of us still, we have only to wait nine minutes for it to happen again. When the alarm goes off in the morning we all have to make a decision. To get up, or not to get up. We set our alarm for the purpose of waking us up in time to get to work or to make an appointment or even just for ourselves. And yet how many of us hit the snooze button instead of turning the alarm off and getting out of bed? We knowingly, deliberately, perhaps half-consciously, choose to act against our better judgement and remain in bed, just for another minute of course.</p> <p>How is it that we can know what we ought to do, what we want to do and not do it anyways?! Philosophers call this phenomenon, of acting against one’s better judgement, akrasia or weakness of will. The problem goes back as far as ancient Greece and remains a topic of discussion in contemporary philosophy.</p> <p>At this meetup we’ll discuss the problem of akrasia, or weakness of will, and try and draw what conclusions we can about this aspect of the human condition.</p> <p>Some questions to ponder: </p> <p>• How is akrasia possible? </p> <p>• What does akrasia mean for us as human beings? </p> <p>• Is akrasia the same thing as weakness of will? </p> <p>Three good articles to read in preparation for the meetup are as follows:</p> <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weakness-will/"><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weakness-will/" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/weakness-will/</a></a></p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia" class="linkified">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrasia</a></a></p> <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Akr"><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Akr" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/#Akr</a></a></p> <p>I look forward to the discussion!</p> <p>Kenny</p> <p>P.S.

We've also spoken about truth and dialectic. Let's now turn our attention to the beautiful with following essay by Arthur Schopenhauer. For this Metup the reading is "On the Metaphysics of the Beautiful and Aesthetics" from the collection <i>Parerga and Paralipomena: Short Philosophical Essays</i>.</p> <p>It can be found here: <a href="http://www.american-buddha.com/lit.parergaschopen.II.19.htm"><a href="http://www.american-buddha.com/lit.parergaschopen.II.19.htm" class="linkified">http://www.american-buddha.com/lit.parergaschopen.II.19.htm</a></a></p> <p>If you're interested in further reading, Schopenhauer is responding to some of Plato's ideas on aesthetics.

"description": "<p>Is there such a thing as truth independent of values, interest, and morals? This gripping question is the subject of Nietzsche's infamous unpublished work "On Truth and Lies in a Non-Moral Sense". Over the years this essay has been interpreted and reinterpreted in a number of ways. It's been seen as a core influence on many post-modernist and post-structuralist thought. Some have taken it to be an early kind of naturalism or proto-pragmatism. Still others insist that it hearkens back to the ancient skeptical tradition. However you read it, come and share your thoughts as we delve into the abyss of this truly controversial essay.</p> <p><a href="http://faculty.uml.edu/enelson/truth&amp;lies.htm"><a href="http://faculty.uml.edu/enelson/truth&amp;lies.htm" class="linkified">http://faculty.uml.edu/enelson/truth&amp;lies.htm</a></a></p> ",

"description": "<p>Come and discuss Graham Harman's essay "Some Preconditions of Universal Philosophical Dialogue".</p> <p>Here's the abstract:</p> <p>"Our own era is widely viewed as a golden age of intellectual tolerance when compared with the persecutions of yesteryear. But in fact, this tolerance serves to mask a fundamental indifference of one perspective to another. Each world view is seen as a personal opinion, walled off from others and immune to challenge or alteration by them. This article blames the current situation in part on the triumph of critical philosophy since Kant. In closing, several concrete and even whimsical proposals are made for remedying the situation and restoring a more wild and fruitful form of intellectual combat of a kind that no longer exists."</p> <p>You can find a PDF of the paper here: <a href="http://dar.aucegypt.edu/bitstream/handle/10526/3508/HarmanPreconditions.pdf?sequence=1"><a href="http://dar.aucegypt.edu/bitstream/handle/10526/3508/HarmanPreconditions.pdf?sequence=1" class="linkified">http://dar.aucegypt.edu/bitstream/handle/10526/3508/HarmanPreconditions.pdf?sequence=1</a></a></p> ",

"description": "<p>In 1927 Arthur Eddington gave the Gifford Lectures. Eddington begins, "I have settled down to the task of writing these lectures and have drawn up my chairs to my two tables. Two tables! Yes; there are duplicates of every object about me - two tables, two chairs, two pens." One table is substantive, relatively permanent, has a certain color, etc. This is the everyday table. The other table is mostly empty space, has many parts which are electrically charged, etc. This is the scientific table. Graham Harman takes Eddington's lecture as his point of departure in his paper "The Third Table." Harman claims that a critical element is missing in this seemingly overpopulated account of the one table as being two tables, an everyday and scientific table. The problem is that these are both ways in which the table appears to us. They are images in the mind; they're not real. There must be a third table, one which lies deeper than the everyday and scientific images. Eddington's two ways of accounting for phenomena is given an influential contemporary articulation in Wilfrid Sellars ideas of the manifest image and the scientific images.

"description": "<p>This week we'll take a stab at the ontology of mathematics. During the first half of the 20th century there were three primary views on the existence of mathematical objects, platonism, intuitionism, and nominalism. Roughly, platonism claims that abstract mathematical objects exist independently of humans, intuitionism claims that mathematical objects exist dependently on humans, and nominalism claims that mathematical objects do not exist. But this will not primarily be a discussion about whether mathematical objects do exist or not. Instead we'll inquire into just what mathematical platonism is exactly; we will try to characterize the metaphysical nature of abstract mathematical objects. This will require of us to engage with metaphysical topics such as truth, existence, concepts, mind, linguistic meaning, etc. It it through these lenses that we will come to see a picture of what mathematical objects are like. Finally, we'll investigate the epistemological side of platonism, or how we can know that such objects exist. I look forward to having a real, down to earth discussion this Sunday.</p> <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/"><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/</a></a></p> ",

"description": "<p>John Archibald Wheeler was an American physicist who helped invent and pioneer many great and challenging ideas in physics. Here we'll look at one of his most famous philosophical ideas, encapsulated in the slogan <i>it from bit</i>. The idea here is that things in the universe, the its, derive their ontology ultimately from information, the bits. <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0765v1.pdf">The primary paper for this discussion</a> survey's Wheeler's great ideas and relates them to one another to paint a picture of how Wheeler saw the universe. It from Bit is at the center of it. A contrasting view is given in a recent paper by Julian Barbour, the aptly titled <a href="http://www.platonia.com/bit_from_it.pdf">Bit from It</a>. Lastly, if you're curious to read Wheeler's own words, <a href="https://jawarchive.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/informationquantumphysics.pdf">this paper</a> of his is a good one.</p> <p>It from Bit is a philosophical position motivated largely by quantum mechanics. It's its own philosophy, and relates to but is distinct from many other views in contemporary philosophy. I think it can be summarily characterized as having a digital ontology derived from an informational analysis of quantum mechanics. Ultimately Wheeler wants to take this idea further and claim that it gives us reason to believe that we not only play an active role in the creation of the universe but a pivotal one.</p> <p>Here are the papers again, in order of priority:</p> <p>1. Cristi Stoica, The Tao of It from Bit,  <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0765v1.pdf"><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0765v1.pdf" class="linkified">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1311.0765v1.pdf</a></a></p> <p>2.

"description": "<p>At this meetup we're going to pivot to our new theme of values. We'll begin with moral values and ask the question "Can moral disputes be resolved?" The question of how to resolve or adjudicate disputes is important in any domain and is a question of contemporary philosophical significance. When dealing with morality this question is even more significant, as the weight of our task is immanent in the morals we are considering. We might approach the question of how to resolve moral disputes by appealing to religion, to reason, to human nature, or to many other ideas. Each appeal presents its own challenges. Join us as we begin our inquiry into values.   </p> <p><a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/can-moral-disputes-be-resolved/"><a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/can-moral-disputes-be-resolved/" class="linkified">http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/07/13/can-moral-disputes-be-resolved/</a></a></p> ",

"description": "<p>Last week we discussed the whether moral disputes can be resolved. One thread of this discussion lead us to see that there are some moral claims people regard as intuitive. But what does it mean to regard a moral claim as intuitive? And what is the proper role of those intuitions in moral reasoning? Getting straight on intuitions may help elucidate what it means for two people to disagree at-bottom on a moral issue. To address intuitions we'll read two things. The first is a short article criticizing intuitions generally as they're used in contemporary philosophical discourse and as the author sees them to have been used historically. The second reading is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy "Intuitionism in Ethics". We'll focus on the epistemology section of that entry. It outlines a few ways of thinking about intuitions, their epistemic status, and their role in disagreement.</p> <p>"Our" Intuitions: <a href="http://edge.org/response-detail/25482"><a href="http://edge.org/response-detail/25482" class="linkified">http://edge.org/response-detail/25482</a></a></p> <p>SEP "Intuitionism in Ethics": <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism-ethics/"><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism-ethics/" class="linkified">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intuitionism-ethics/</a></a></p> ",

"description": "<p>This week we'll continue our discussion of Schopenhauer's philosophy. There was some confusion last time regarding how much of Kant's philosophy Schopenhaeur is adopting, revising, and/or abandoning. In addition, a few questions seemed to occupy our discussion:</p> <p>1. What is Will or the Will?</p> <p>2. What role do Plato's Ideas or Forms play in Schopenhauer's philosophy?</p> <p>3. What are the metaphysics behind Schopenhauer's pessimism and ethics?</p> <p>To mitigate our confusion about Schopenhauer's relationship with Kant and to address the questions above, we'll focus on the encyclopedia articles below, which have sections dedicated to each of these topics and present a good overview of his philosophy. Keep the above questions in mind while you read. And as always, bring any questions of your own to the reading and to the discussion.</p> <p><a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schopenhauer/">Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry</a></p> <p><a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/schopenh/">Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry</a> </p> ",

We'll begin with introductions as always. Come with a question that you have about the text and its subject matter. Then we'll spend the first part of the discussion doing a close reading of the text. The idea is to slowly, carefully go through passages in the text as a group and try to understand what it's about. The second and final part of the discussion will be when we respond to the text. This is when we give voice to where we agree or disagree and why.</p> <p>Happy reading!</p> ",

"description": "<p>Before moving to ethics proper, I thought we'd spend one more week on reason in meta-ethics.</p> <p><a href="http://files.meetup.com/328570/Proleptic%20Reasons%20Final%20Nov%201.PDF"><a href="http://files.meetup.com/328570/Proleptic%20Reasons%20Final%20Nov%201.PDF" class="linkified">http://files.meetup.com/328570/Proleptic%20Reasons%20Final%20Nov%201.PDF</a></a></p> <p>Here's the Abstract:</p> <p>"Sometimes we engage in pursuits whose value is not fully accessible to us at the outset. When we embark upon parenthood, or a new career, or the appreciation of classical music, we make a foray into a new domain of value. Our reason for proceeding is the intrinsic value of the domain in question—but this is a value we cannot, as yet, grasp. I argue that we must introduce a new kind of reason—a proleptic reason—in order to rationalize these large-scale transformative pursuits. The proleptic reasoner is marked by an awareness of the defect in her appreciation of some value, and a felt need to improve. I argue that the work done by proleptic reasons cannot be done by more familiar kinds of reasons, such as a vague grasp of the value in question, reliance on the ethical testimony of a mentor figure, or recourse to self-management techniques of (dis)incentivization. Finally, I consider the implications of the existence of proleptic rationality for reasons-internalism. Internalists hold that what I have reason to do can be arrived at by a kind of procedurally rational extrapolation from my current desires. Because the act of learning some new form of valuation cannot be analyzed as a form of satisfying or rendering consistent the values one already has, proleptic reasons are not internal reasons."</p> ",

"description": "<p>The past few decades has seen a resurgence of interest in sword and sandals. More exactly, someone has been reading their Cicero and rediscovering a conception of political virtue and organization that was not represented by modernity. This neo-republican conception of liberty is modeled after the example of slavery, i.e. of not being a slave. Think here of the slaves of antiquity. They included not only farm hands and house maids, but also celebrity gladiators and intellectual tutors. Their distinction was that their lives were determined by the arbitrary will of others.</p> <p>In the 20th century we conceived of liberty mainly as either the freedom to be left alone (Locke and Berlin's negative liberty) or the freedom to do the right thing (Kant and Berlin's positive liberty). Let's not be swayed by Berlin's opposition into believing that these options are exhaustive or even definitive of a single spectrum along which freedom is always defined. Pettit introduces us to a third option, freedom as anti-power.</p> <p><a href="https://philpapers.org/archive/PETFAA-2.pdf" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/archive/PETFAA-2.pdf</a></p> ",

In his "Principles of Human Understanding", George Berkeley makes the case against unseen falling trees. Since then, philosophers have taken issue with one or another step in Berkeley's argument, so as to restore our conviction that object permanence is a progressive rather than regressive step of developmental psychology. Campbell takes a second look at the argument and responses to it, and finds new insights relating to conceivability. We'll read mainly Campbell's own paper, but it will be useful to read the background text by Berkeley himself.</p> <p><a href="https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/file/70/Berkeley.pdf" class="linkified">https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/file/70/Berkeley.pdf</a></p> <p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/BERTPO-54" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/BERTPO-54</a> (optional)</p> ",

"description": "<p>"When contemporary analytic philosophers run out of arguments, they appeal to intuition. Intuitiveness is supposed to be a virtue, counter-intuitiveness a vice. It can seem, and is sometimes said, that any philosophical dispute, when pushed back far enough, turns into a conflict of intuitions about ultimate premises: ‘In the end, all we have to go on is our intuitions’. Yet analytic philosophy has no agreed or even popular account of how intuition might work, no accepted explanation of the hoped-for correlation between our having an intuition that P and its being true that P. Since analytic philosophy prides itself on its rigour, this blank space in its foundations looks like a methodological scandal. What is intuition? Why should it have any authority over the philosophical domain?"</p> <p>This is the first paragraph of this week's reading. We're reading Timothy Williamson's, "Philosophical Intuitions and Scepticism about Judgement".</p> <p><a href="http://media.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/assets/pdf_file/0008/1313/intuit3.pdf" class="linkified">http://media.philosophy.ox.ac.uk/assets/pdf_file/0008/1313/intuit3.pdf</a></p> ",

"description": "<p>According to the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, what happens in the double-slit experiment is that the particle literally goes through both slits. Rather than there being something like two particles, one for each slit, there are instead two entire worlds, such that the particle goes through either slit, for each world, and it appears as though it goes through one or the other, when measured, because measurement itself happens distinctly at each world. There are in effect many worlds, even if there usually appears to be only one. Not surprisingly, philosophy takes great interest in trying to settle whether and how to take this possibility seriously, and equally not surprisingly, the question is usually returned to the physicists as the math and technical details get overly complicated.</p> <p>For this week, we'll read one philosopher's attempt to distill what we need to know in order to begin to ask the right questions, while assuming nothing more mathematically challenging than complex numbers. We'll read "A Prolegomenon to the Ontology of the Everett Interpretation" by David Wallace, which is the last chapter in "The Wave Function" edited by Alyssa Ney and David Albert.</p> <p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/NEYTWF" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/NEYTWF</a></p> ",

A good enough theory of events and of causation might give us reason to accept some things that seem intuitively to be false, but no theory should persuade us that delaying a forest’s burning for a month (or indeed for a minute) is causing a forest fire.</p> <p>2.</p> <p>Suppose that Jones lives in a very dangerous neighborhood, and that one evening Smith attempts to stab him to death. Jones is saved because of the action of Brown who frightens Smith off. However, a year later, Jones is shot to death by the persistent Smith. So, if Brown’s action had not occurred, Jones’s death due to the shooting would not have occurred, since he would have died of stab wounds a year earlier. But, I find it intuitively quite unacceptable to suppose that Brown’s action was a cause of Jones’s dying as a result of gunshot a year later.</p> <p>3.</p> <p>It is one thing to postpone an event, another to cancel it. A cause without which it would have occurred later, or sooner, is not a cause without which it would not have occurred at all. Who would dare be a doctor, if the hypothesis under consideration [that an event’s time is essential to it] were right? You might manage to keep your patient alive until 4:12, when otherwise he would have died at 4:08. You would then have caused his death. For his death was, in fact, his death at 4:12. If that time is essential, his death is an event that would not have occurred had he died at 4:08, as he would have done without your action. That will not do.</p> <p>Something is wrong. These are examples of causation, in some sense, but in some other they are not.

"description": "<p>Before philosophy dares to ask what it's all about, we must come to grips with what it is for a question or statement to be about anything in particular. Consider this extended passage:</p> <p>---</p> <p>The statement</p> <p>Maine has many lakes</p> <p>is obviously about Maine. Since Aroostook County is in Maine, the statement</p> <p>Aroostook County grows potatoes</p> <p>seems also to be about Maine. So also, since Maine is in New England, do the two statements</p> <p>New England is north of Pennsylvania<br/>New England States are small.</p> <p>Apparently we speak about Maine whenever we speak about anything contained in (whether as part, member, member of member, etc.), Maine, and whenever we speak about anything that contains Maine. But to accept this principle is ... to be saddled with the conclusion that any statement about anything is a statement about Maine. Consider the statement</p> <p>Florida is Democratic.</p> <p>According to the principle stated, this is about the United States and therefore about Maine. The statement</p> <p>Satellites are planets,</p> <p>since it is about the universe and thus about whatever is in the universe, would also be about Maine.</p> <p>Just where did we go wrong? Perhaps we generalized too fast; perhaps only some, not all, statements about what contains or is contained in Maine are about Maine. For example,</p> <p>New England borders on New York</p> <p>does not say that Maine borders on New York; nor does</p> <p>Portland is without lakes</p> <p>say that Maine is without lakes. Yet to say of the biggest city in Maine that it has no lakes, or to say of the section of the United States containing Maine that it borders on New York, is pretty clearly to say something about Maine.</p> <p>Our dilemma is rather deep-seated. Given any statement, we can argue plausibly that it is about Maine. On the other hand, to admit that every statement, is about Maine is to make utterly pointless any assertion that a given statement is or is not about anything in particular.</p> <p>---</p> <p>This week we'll be reading Nelson Goodman's, "About", in an effort to settle this dilemma.</p> <p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/GOOA-4" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/GOOA-4</a></p> ",

"description": "<p>It isn't atypical for philosophers in our time to be dismissive of the ultimate questions such as what is the meaning of life. They say it's too pretentious, too vague, or otherwise ill-conceived. The few who have dared have usually taken after Sartre's suggestion that life is what you make of it, leaving the question of meaning or purpose entirely up to each of us individually, essentially denying that life has any meaning of its own independently of the meaning that we choose to assign to it.</p> <p>In contrast to the conventional evasion or existentialist imposition, there is a small number of philosophers who have suggested the very bold, if obvious, idea that we might learn about the meaning of life, by relating the philosophy of meaning to the philosophy of life. Philosophy of meaning is taken up by the philosophy of language, of which one tradition begins with the conception of words as artifacts that serve functions, such as tools do. And philosophy of life is otherwise known as the philosophy of biology, or the scientific study of life. Ultimately, the philosophical problems get difficult when we ask how it is possible to attribute intrinsic functions, with their essentially normative aspects, to living systems.</p> <p>Before we ask what is the meaning of life in general, we ask what is the meaning of any one life, or of any part of any one life. For instance, what is the meaning or purpose of a heart. The answer is that the purpose of a heart is to circulate blood through the body. Blood circulation is the heart's function, it is what the heart is for. But this sort of purposive language presents difficulties for our physicalist conception of the natural world. Accounting for this mismatch is the philosophical problem we will discuss. In 1984, Ruth Millikan proposed a way to do just this. And in 1989, she responded to some of her critics. We'll be reading the latter.</p> <p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/MILIDO-2" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/MILIDO-2</a><br/><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.553.9509&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" class="linkified">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.553.9509&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf</a></p> ",

"description": "<p>Last week we discussed the notions of functions and purpose. What are these notions for? Historically, the appeal to function and purpose was used to provide teleological explanations. When Little Red Riding Hood says to the Wolf, “What big eyes you have.” and the Wolf replies, “All the better to see you with, my dear.”, the Wolf is giving a teleological explanation of the size of his eyes. His eyes are big for the purpose of seeing. Can openers are designed the way they are in order to open cans. The heart has the form it has so that it may pump blood. Form follows function, as the saying goes. Aristotle tells us that everything in nature has its end or purpose or function, but since the time of the scientific revolution the idea that absolutely everything has a purpose or function has been taboo in science, or at least in the physical sciences. It’s clear however that biology as well as our ordinary thought and talk are replete with teleological explanations, as we can see from the examples given. So what characterizes these explanations? How can they be accounted for to fit with our modern scientific sensibilities? To address these questions, this week we’ll read “The teleological notion of ‘function’” by Karen Neander. “Teleological explanations explain the means by the ends”, she says. To make these explanations scientifically palatable, a more modern conception is needed. Neander provides us with an etiological account of teleology, thus assimilating this ancient class of explanation to a modern one. “We do not understand teleological explanations correctly, as a species of ordinary causal explanation, unless we understand that they are not only explicitly 'forward-looking' but also implicitly 'backward-looking'.”</p> <p><a href="http://www.sfu.ca/~jillmc/Neanderteleo.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.sfu.ca/~jillmc/Neanderteleo.pdf</a><br/><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/NEATTN" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/NEATTN</a></p> ",

"description": "<p>Recently we have considered how meanings and norms may be naturalizable. It's an ambitious claim, but in character, not without close antecedents. Fifteen years before, Quine proposed a reversal of the traditional disciplinary priorities.</p> <p>Descartes, and nearly everyone else since then, really, argued that we must first establish what we know and how we know it, and only then establish the edifice of knowledge we have come to know as science. As a branch of this body of scientific knowledge, there is psychology, the study of human behavior and of those theoretical brain states by which we explain the behavior. In time, we overcame our reservations and came to call these states "mental", fully aware that the elements of mind were the very foundation upon which Descartes and others had erected the justification of all science to begin with. There is a priority concern. If psychology were in its conclusions to contradict what we know self-evidently about reason and consciousness by which we understand logic, experimentation, method, and so on, then psychological conclusions could conceivably undermine science and so undermine itself.</p> <p>Eventually, someone would face this circularity and it came to be Quine. We'll read his "Epistemology Naturalized", in which he argued that instead of producing a theory of knowledge from which to build psychology, we could take what we have learned from psychology, and turn it around to erect upon it a theory of knowledge, a theory of knowledge as psychological mental state. Rather than suggest that psychology must be self-evident or otherwise stand on its own, he recommended that there is an interdependence of justification, effectively weakening the supposedly separate and distinct domains of philosophy and science, and their relative priority.</p> <p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/QUIEN" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/QUIEN</a><br/><a href="http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/3330/Quine-Epistemology-Naturalized.pdf" class="linkified">http://joelvelasco.net/teaching/3330/Quine-Epistemology-Naturalized.pdf</a></p> ",

"description": "<p>Philosophical argument often relies upon so-called intuitions, variously conceived as uncritical opinions or intellectual appearances. For example, we have the intuition that knowledge cannot be accidental or that the pope is not a bachelor, from which we draw conclusions about the nature of epistemic justification and of conceptual analysis, respectively. But proceeding from intuition has very often proven to be inconclusive, as different philosophers share different intuitions, or worse, as the intuitions of the philosophers don't coincide with those of non-philosophers.</p> <p>In response to this diversity, some philosophers have taken up the techniques of cognitive science to survey and investigate the intuitive judgments of populations generally. The premise is that if we better understand the intuitions themselves, we may better understand the role played by intuition in philosophical argumentation. The result was unsettling as we discovered patterns of disagreement, which throw into relief the very idea of relying on intuition for argument in the first place.</p> <p>Shaun Nichols and Joshua Knobe pioneered this kind of investigation and dubbed it experimental philosophy. This week we'll read their survey of the intuitions at the heart of the compatibilism debate, in their "Moral responsibility and determinism: The cognitive science of folk intuitions".</p> <p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/NICMRA-2" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/NICMRA-2</a><br/><a href="http://www.pgrim.org/philosophersannual/pa27articles/nicholsknobe.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.pgrim.org/philosophersannual/pa27articles/nicholsknobe.pdf</a></p> ",

"description": "<p>The devil made me do it! I had no other choice, so I am not responsible! Anyway, I couldn't have done otherwise, so I didn't act freely.</p> <p>The intuition by which this reasoning is compelling is explored by Harry Frankfurt in a 1969 paper about free will, "Alternative Possibilities and Moral Responsibility". I will spoil the suspense by telling you that he finds the intuition less than compelling on closer examination. Even when you have no alternatives, there is a sense in which you can act freely.</p> <p>Years later in 1996, Carl Ginet, in his "In Defense of the Principle of Alternative Possibilities", insisted that without those alternatives, we may as well blame the devil.</p> <p>The first order argument is between freedom and determinism. Since this assumes that freedom and determinism are incompatible with each other, the second order argument is between incompatibilism and compatibilism. We'll read both papers for this week.</p> <p><a href="http://www.jeffsnapper.org/assets/frankfurtapmr.pdf" class="linkified">http://www.jeffsnapper.org/assets/frankfurtapmr.pdf</a><br/><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/FRAAPA-8" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/FRAAPA-8</a><br/><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/GINIDO-2" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/GINIDO-2</a></p> ",

Quine recommended relocating the theory of knowledge to psychology, on the grounds that absent foundationalist concerns, there remained no reasons to insist on the priority of epistemology. In response, we considered Jaegwon Kim's argument that justification remains normative, and this week we'll consider Hilary Putnam's take on this question. He considers justification in its relation to rationality by arguing for "Why Reason Can't Be Naturalized". This is also the second lecture in a two part sequence.

"description": "<p>We have had a year long debate on this question and we are finally doing the reading required to pursue it with care. Using deceptively simple language, the question is whether there are more than mere things. Take all the fundamental individual things, including their fundamental properties and relations. Is anything left unspecified? Are two possible worlds, identical in all their individual specifics, themselves identical? The thesis called Humean Supervenience answers, yes, as does Rodrigo and the author of this week's paper "Humean Supervenience" by David Lewis. Kenny, cautiously reluctant to assent to any metaphysical claims that seem to hazard a priori reasoning, is concerned that this claim leaves important questions about chance, universals, laws, norms, and other metaphysical notions out in the cold.</p> <p>We are all beginners this week.

The topic continues to interest us, so this week we will followup with opinions by two more philosophers on Grice's original article. We'll read Max Black's, "Meaning and Intention" and A. P. Martinich's, "Meaning and Intention: Black versus Grice".</p> <p>We often lament that modern philosophy is rarely written in the form of dialogue after the example of Plato's Socratic dialogues. As it happens, very nearly all published philosophy remains in dialogue. Its dialectical form is obscured by our practice of reading only one side of the conversation at a time, in segments of many pages. Here we have a chance to read Black in response to Grice, and then Martinich in response to both of them in papers that altogether form a dialogue of sorts.</p> <p>Of course, there is still something missing if the responses and counter-responses are each 10+ pages instead of 10 words or sentences at a time.

"description": "<p>Our discussion on the fact/value dichotomy raised a question central to the normativity of values and practical reasoning. If reasons are what motivate our action, are these reasons ever and/or always mental states, such as desires? Bernard Williams is skeptical that our reasons for action are ever external to us. Even if we balance one desire against another, delaying gratification or suppressing destructive impulses, it is always some other desire that motivates the delay or the suppression. Others insist that mind-independent self-standing reasons for action are compelling on their own and motivate us, or motivate the rational among us, to do what is right.</p> <p>We'll read Bernard Williams's accounting of this divide and his defense of the internalist position, as well as a followup essay on obligation. These are chapters 8 and 9 of "Moral Luck".</p> <p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/WILMLP" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/WILMLP</a></p> ",

Has its validity been staring us in the face, and our rejection of skepticism been altogether self-serving and even unnecessary?

Hume argued that we have some knowledge on the basis of the "relations of ideas", but how do we know these relations and how are these relations still relevant to knowledge of the world? If we know that bachelors are men, on the basis of the idea of a bachelor and the idea of a man, what do these ideas and their relation have to do with bachelors and men themselves?</p> <p>Because this is a review, we'll have a second reading as well, a response to Quine by Paul Grice and Peter Strawson, "In Defense of a Dogma". We will have two readings in this way whenever we review a past reading. Only the review paper is required. The second is just to keep the rest of us motivated. The zealous beginners will of course want to read both.</p> <p>Like last week, this is a display of two or three old men pointing fingers at each other.

"description": "<p>Donald Davidson understands how empiricism has driven us toward private worlds of subjective experience. But does this result make sense. In “The Myth of the Subjective”, Davidson writes:</p> <p>“Minds are many, nature is one. Each of us has his own position in the world, and hence his own perspective on it. It is easy to slide from this truism to some confused notion of conceptual relativism. The former, harmless, relativism is just the familiar relativism of position in space and time. Because each of us preempts a volume of space-time, two of us cannot be in exactly the same place at the same time. The relations among our positions are intelligible because we can locate each person in a single, common world, and a shared time frame.<br/>Conceptual relativism may seem similar, but the analogy is hard to carry out. For what is the common reference point, or system of coordinates, to which each scheme is relative? Without a good answer to this question, the claim that each of us in some sense inhabits his own world loses its intelligibility.”</p> <p><a href="https://philpapers.org/rec/DAVTMO-18" class="linkified">https://philpapers.org/rec/DAVTMO-18</a></p> ",
