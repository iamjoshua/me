# Story Telling

I often hear high praise for storytelling in the form of unsubstantiated evolutionary claims along the lines that "we are wired for stories."

But I also hear from good storytellers that a good story always follows a logical structure so that the audience can anticipate the unfolding of the story and become engaged.

So wouldn't it be more explanatory to say instead that we are actually wired for logical structure? 

Afterall, we aren't receptive to just any story, but "good" stories. 

An easier claim to defend empirically would be that we "are wired" for causal reasoning, and, as far as we can tell, the causal structure of the world is logical, enabling us to reason about it and survive.

But logic is concerned with the preservation of truth, given true premises, so it would seem that our predilection for logical structure is in service of preserving truth.

However, these storytelling claims are often used to imply a dismissive stance on truth, valuing instead the emotional impact of a "good" story. 

Some popular intellectuals have gone as far as suggestiong that nothing is or can be true and all is but a narrative. 

This seems to me to be a perversion of the matter. 

If a "good" story is logical, and logic preserves truth but doesn't introduce or make truth, then a story must have a structure but also content. 

Hemmingway said in his book on writing advice to endeavor "to write one true thing." He wrote non-fiction for a newspaper when he was younger but of course he is most remembered for his fictional work. Clearly he meant to include both forms of writing in his advice. 

A "good" story should be "true" in the logical sense of being self-consistent. 

There should be "truth in it" even if it's about a war between advanced species of hamsters in space ships.

A story can additinally have fictional or true content. 

But what does not follow from all of this is that truth is subordinant to stories. 
This view has things exactly backwards. 
After all, there can be no understanding of what makes a good story "good" without appeal to logic.
As logic is concerned with the preservation of truth, then it would seem that far from being "wired for stories", we are, instead, wired for Truth.
