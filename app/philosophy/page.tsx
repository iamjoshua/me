              I've had a life-long love of philosophy, but it wasn't until my
              mid 30's that I learned that modern analytic philosophy was alive
              and thriving. Ever since, I've been committed to getting up to
              date on the academic literature with the hope of one day
              contributing. I study broadly, but with an emphasis on the
              philosophy of mind.{" "}
